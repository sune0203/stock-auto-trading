On July 9, 2025, the Company published a trading update for the first half of 2025, disclosing that it had allegedly “seen a deterioration in performance as Q2 has progressed” due to both “continued macro uncertainty weighing on client spend and weaker net new business than originally anticipated,” as well as “some distraction to the business” as a result of the continued restructuring of WPP Media a.k.a. GroupM. The Company further disclosed that its CEO “will retire from the Board and as CEO on 31 December 2025.” On this news, the price of WPP’s shares fell from a closing price of $35.82 per share on July 8, 2025 to $29.34 per share on July 9, 2025, a decline of about 18.1% in the span of just a single day.

    "content": "Las Vegas, NV, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --      Virtual reality  (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies have been around for  decades. However, marketers in the medical device, pharmaceutical, and  life science industries continue to find new ways to leverage these  immersive technologies to  generate brand momentum and produce  meaningful engagement. And the data around VR/AR innovation tells a compelling story of explosive growth and escalating investment, signaling how healthcare professionals in general and tradeshow attendees in particular expect to interact with new products and innovations. Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality by the Numbers If you want to understand the growing influence of AR/VR, check the  market data. The global medical simulation market was valued at $1.65  billion in 2024 and is projected to skyrocket to $4.17 billion by 2030 ( Grand View Research ). In the U.S. alone, the AR/VR healthcare market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 15.4% through 2030 ( Grand View Research ). Other forecasts are similarly optimistic about the AR/VR healthcare  market. While many assessments focus on these technologies in clinical  settings, there is no doubt that practitioners who have access to them  at work are increasingly expecting to see them leveraged effectively at  tradeshows. And all indicators are that this isn’t just a trend—it’s a  transformation that is underway and will have a lasting impact. For  healthcare marketers, the question is no longer if they should  incorporate VR and AR, but how they can leverage these tools to create  an immersive healthcare trade show experience that captivates, educates,  and persuades. Why VR and AR Work Well at Tradeshows The tradeshow environment is inherently noisy and competitive. Booths  vie for attention, and attendees are often inundated with information.  Cutting through this clutter requires more than a clever slogan or an  attractive display. It requires immersive"

    "content": "Denver, CO, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Asbestos is a hidden hazard still lingering in many Colorado homes,  schools, and commercial buildings. Though once widely used for  insulation, fireproofing, and construction materials, asbestos can  release dangerous fibers when disturbed. Inhaling these fibers is linked  to serious health risks including asbestosis, lung cancer, and  mesothelioma. For property owners, the question is not if asbestos should be  managed, but how. Choosing the right remediation strategy impacts  health, safety, project budgets, long-term maintenance, and compliance  with Colorado laws and regulations. This article compares two primary approaches: asbestos removal  (abatement) and asbestos encapsulation. Our goal is to help you  understand the pros and cons of asbestos abatement vs encapsulation and  make an informed decision for your property. What Is Asbestos Removal? Asbestos removal/abatement is the process of completely and  permanently eliminating an asbestos-containing material (ACM) from a  property. This complex job must be performed by licensed contractors who  adhere to strict safety procedures to protect everyone from exposure. The process begins with professional testing and inspection to  identify materials containing asbestos. To prevent the spread of  dangerous fibers during the work, contractors set up containment areas  with negative air pressure systems. The crew uses protective equipment  and specialized tools for removing the material, which is then placed in  sealed containers for transport to a designated hazardous waste  facility. After the work is done, post-removal clearance testing is conducted  to confirm the building is safe for people to re-occupy. Although  getting rid of the material is the most thorough and permanent solution,  asbestos removal costs are typically higher upfront, and the process  requires temporary closure of the building. What Is Asbestos Encapsulation? Asbestos encapsulation does not r"

    "content": "Omaha, NE, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The  commercial cleaning industry is booming. That’s no surprise. Everyone  appreciates a clean space, whether it's an office, restaurant, or retail  store. But running a cleaning business isn't all about gleaming floors  and happy customers. Like every small business, cleaning companies face  risks that come with financial consequences. That's where commercial cleaning insurance comes  in. It acts like a financial safety net for your business, paying costs  related to covered events so you can stay focused on doing your best  work. This article details how commercial cleaning insurance  protects businesses, including why having coverage is essential,  examples of common cleaning hazards and claims, and how the claims  process works. Let’s get into the critical topic of insurance for a small cleaning business. Is insurance really needed for a cleaning company? If  you’ve always worked carefully and have never caused property damage,  been sued, or had any other type of incident, it would be fair to  wonder, “Is insurance needed for a cleaning company like mine?” The  answer to that question is yes, your business should have coverage. The  fact that you’ve gotten by without business insurance for your cleaning  company until now doesn’t mean you’ll continue to operate  incident-free. Your first issue might occur next month, next week, or  tomorrow. We hope it doesn’t, but there’s simply no way to know. What  you can be sure of is that just one incident (even a seemingly minor  one) that isn’t covered by commercial cleaning insurance can produce a  significant expense. Sadly, uninsured businesses can be forced to shut  down by the high cost of lawsuits, property damage, and other events. But  it’s a different story if you have business insurance for your cleaning  company. When a covered incident occurs, your policy can pay the  associated costs, meaning the money doesn’t have to come out of your  savings or revenues, ena"

Whatever you call it  internally, one thing is clear: It is a fundamental requirement in your  safety management system. The FAA’s AC 120-92D outlines the necessity of maintaining a hazard log: § 5.55(c) and (d) – Safety Risk Assessment and Control Any organization required to have an SMS must: Develop and maintain safety risk controls based on the risk assessment process. Evaluate whether a risk is acceptable before implementing safety controls. Guidance 3.4.6.5.5 emphasizes that safety risk management (SRM) processes should be simple and effective. It also prompts organizations to ask: How do we identify safety issues—through incident reports, safety reports, or another method? Do we have a hazard log, and more importantly, are we actually using it? When  I first encountered safety management systems, my focus was on safety  reports, FRATs, safety meetings, SMS training and change management.  Later, I tackled safety objectives and performance indicators. But the  hazard log? That only hit my radar when preparing for my first  audit—when I suddenly had to get up to speed fast. Looking back, I wondered why I had overlooked it. The answers were simple: I was overwhelmed learning a new role. The safety risk profile seemed too complex. No one emphasized its importance early on. During  the audit, conversations with auditors opened my eyes to how often  hazard logs are neglected across the industry. Over time, I made it a  point to discuss this issue with every auditor I met. Their experiences  confirmed that many organizations struggled with this critical  component. In my current role, I have the privilege to observe  organizations from behind the scenes and work directly with clients to  enhance their SMS programs. Unsurprisingly, the most overlooked area is  the hazard log. Before we dive into why hazard logs are so important, let’s first explore why they’"

(NASDAQ: CRMT) resulting from allegations that America’s Car-Mart, Inc. may have issued materially misleading business information to the investing public. SO WHAT: If you purchased America’s Car-Mart, Inc. securities you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. The Rosen Law Firm is preparing a class action seeking recovery of investor losses.

WHAT IS THIS ABOUT: On September 4, 2025, during market hours, Benzinga published an article entitled “America’s Car-Mart Stock Plunges After Sales Volume Dip, Delinquency Uptick.” The article stated that America’s Car-Mart, Inc. stock was trading “lower after the company reported first-quarter results. The company reported a first-quarter loss of 69 cents per share, compared with a net loss of 15 cents per share in the year-ago period.” On this news, America’s Car-Mart, Inc. stock fell 18.2% on September 4, 2025.

Set in 14-karat gold and glistening with over 800 custom-cut, hand-set gemstones, the Thunder's breathtaking ring is centered around a showstopping ring-within-the-ring feature. The ring top boldly boasts their hard-fought “NBA CHAMPIONS” title and Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy with over 100 diamonds collectively set in 14-karat gold. The familiar “OKC” mark and Shield are prominently positioned on the face of the ring, laced with luminous diamonds. The Shield is intentionally filled with custom-cut diamonds, meticulously set together to represent the bond of the team.  The sparkling background surrounding the Shield is filled with radiant, custom-cut diamonds. Forty-six taper-cut genuine blue sapphires encircle the logo, as the ring intends to celebrate the Thunder’s deep connection to the State of Oklahoma, their devoted community and their fan base who have supported the team's journey to triumph. An additional 71 diamonds and 34 emerald-cut diamonds adorn the outer edge. The story of the Thunder's season continues with a brilliant reveal: the immaculate ring top opens to present a bespoke inner band. This groundbreaking design allows each player to wear the inner band ring as an alternative to their championship ring. There are 94 diamonds along the top and bottom edges of the inner band which features a unique engraving of the player's signature and their"

He emphasized the sustainable and market-oriented approach of China's maritime connectivity strategy within the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). He also told the Global Times that this platform is not a one-way export channel but aims to create an international cooperation network that benefits all participants. \"For Poland, a gateway to the European Union, China's initiative presents significant opportunities,\" Juchniewicz said, noting plans to leverage the Silk Road Maritime platform to strengthen connections between Poland's logistics hubs and jointly explore the Central and Eastern European market. His vision was echoed at the 7th Silk Road Maritime International Cooperation Forum held on September 8-9 in Xiamen in East China's Fujian Province, where participants were focusing on strengthening win-win cooperation and fostering innovation among partners along the Maritime Silk Road, amid global trade challenges. The forum drew more than 1,500 participants from more than 30 countries and regions, including government officials, international organization representatives, experts, and executives from ports, shipping lines, trade and logistics. Under the theme \"Seamless Port and Shipping, Boundless Silk Road Trade,\" the forum aimed to strengthen Maritime Silk Road transport links, boost exchanges within the port and shipping industries, and advance investment and trade liberalization and facilitation.

With an installed capacity of 500 kilowatt, it can save over 50,000 yuan ($6,968.4) in electricity costs monthly, effectively reducing agricultural production's operational costs and greenhouse gas emissions. During this year's Solar & Storage Live Egypt, held from April 29 to 30, the company signed framework agreements for the supply of 50 megawatts of photovoltaic modules with Egyptian distribution partners Egypta Group and Reestech. Following this, LONGi, together with Huawei, Egypta Group, and Egyptian project owner Mecca, signed a 30-megawatt project cooperation agreement, the company told the Global Times in a statement. This collaboration marked strong recognition of the solar tech company's product solutions in the Egyptian market, with the three parties jointly promoting the widespread application of high-efficiency photovoltaic modules in the country, the company noted. Cooperation in the field of solar power between enterprises of the two countries is a microcosm of the high-quality collaboration between China and Egypt under the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). According to the Xinhua News Agency, in recent years, Chinese enterprises in Egypt have achieved numerous African \"firsts\": constructing the continent's tallest building, establishing and operating a world-class large-scale glass fiber production base, assisting in the construction of Egypt's largest vaccine storage center, building and operating Africa's largest and most technologically advanced cement production cluster, and helping Egypt become the first African country with comprehensive satellite assembly, integration, and testing capabilities.

    "content": "Beijing, China, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In Beijing's Olympics landmark \"Ice Ribbon\" National Speed Skating Oval, humanoid robots came to life this week at the inaugural World Humanoid Robot Games (WHRG) - delivering dance routines, martial arts display, musical performances, and athletic feats that blurred the line between spectacle and science. With more than 500 robots from 280 teams across 16 countries participating, the three-day competition features events ranging from soccer, boxing, and track races to real-world scenarios such as medicine sorting and cleaning services - offering a striking glimpse into the rapidly evolving frontier of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. Beyond the spectacles at the WHRG, these robots also hold vast potential for international cooperation, including among partner countries of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). From the launch of the Belt and Road Science, Technology and Innovation Cooperation Action Plan in 2017, to the inclusion of scientific and technological innovation among the eight major steps for supporting high-quality BRI cooperation in 2023, scientific and technological cooperation is an important component of jointly building the BRI. Amid rising unilateralism and protectionism globally, technology cooperation, including in the robotics industry, has injected fresh momentum into BRI development. The trend was vividly showcased at both the WHRG and the just-concluded 2025 World Robot Conference (WRC) in Beijing, and was widely recognized by guests from BRI partner countries. Wang Peng, an associate research fellow at the Beijing Academy of Social Sciences, said that most BRI partner countries are emerging economies and developing nations, where industrialization and modernization are accelerating, creating strong demand for robotics and vast market potential.

As this year's ASEAN chair, Malaysia has maintained close trade ties with China. In 2024, bilateral trade exceeded 1.5 trillion yuan ($212 billion), with China remaining Malaysia's largest trading partner for more than a decade. Malaysia is China's second-largest trading partner in ASEAN. One of the most iconic achievements of China-Malaysia cooperation under the BRI, Loh said, is the \"Two Countries, Twin Parks\" model — the Malaysia-China Kuantan Industrial Park and the China-Malaysia Qinzhou Industrial Park, which has been operating for over a decade. \"Both parks are now almost fully occupied,\" he noted, calling the model a benchmark for bilateral industrial collaboration. Loh also highlighted that the flagship BRI project jointly built by Malaysia and China, the East Coast Rail Link, is now in its final phase of construction and is expected to become operational by late 2026 or early 2027. Loh expressed hope that more large-scale infrastructure projects would be successfully launched and implemented in Malaysia in the coming years. \"Our foundation in infrastructure cooperation is strong,\" Loh said. He noted that several large-scale projects in Penang, including a new international airport, are progressing with active participation from Chinese enterprises. \"We expect more Chinese capital and technology to enter Malaysia in the coming years.\" Speaking about the value of CISCE to Malaysian businesses, Loh said its focus on green energy, the digital economy a"

    "content": "SYDNEY, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Geotab Inc . and its affiliates (“Geotab”), the global leader in connected vehicle and asset solutions, and Vitality , have formed a joint venture to improve driver safety and well-being, reduce risk and support better road safety. Following its beta launch in Canada, US and in Europe earlier this year, Geotab Vitality is now available in Australia, rewarding drivers for safer behaviours. This first-of-its-kind solution combines Geotab’s advanced telematics and AI-powered predictive collision analytics with Vitality’s proven behavioural science, creating a new way to inspire and reward safer driving habits. Geotab Vitality is fully integrated in the MyGeotab platform, providing drivers with personalised goals based on past performance, to encourage steady progress each week. Daily improvements translate into points, which are tracked using Geotab’s predictive collision risk model. When drivers achieve their weekly goals, they unlock real-world, localised rewards such as coffee or gift cards, which can then be redeemed via an in-app Rewards Mall. This positive, reward-based system reinforces long-term safe driving habits across fleets of all sizes, helping ensure driver engagement and lasting impact. Early results from similar global programs show a 15% improvement in driver behaviour within the first 30 days, as well as 55% fewer insurance claims compared to national averages. The need for such solutions is urgent. Collisions cost Australian fleets billions yearly, harming drivers, communities, and profitability. According to the Australian Government’s study of Social cost of road crashes , road crashes cost $27 billion annually (2016–2020). The new joint offering provides fleets with access to an all-in-one behaviour change platform, leveraging Vitality’s science-backed toolkit to incentivise and reward safe driving. This proactive, positive reinforcement model is designed to reduce accident-related costs, improve driver"

    "content": "Beijing, China, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Since 2017, the Maldives has participated in the joint construction of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which has already yielded fruitful results. At this year's two sessions, China vowed to strive for solid progress in pursuing high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. What does that mean for cooperation between China and BRI partners like the Maldives? What are the prospects for BRI cooperation in 2025 and beyond? Fazeel Najeeb (Fazeel), the Maldives' Ambassador to China, shared his perspectives with Global Times (GT) reporter Yin Yeping in this exclusive interview. GT: China's Government Work Report states that last year, impressive strides were made in pursuing high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, and steady progress was secured in a number of major projects and public wellbeing programs. How do you evaluate China-Maldives cooperation under the BRI? Fazeel: The BRI, of which the Maldives has been a partner country for over 10 years, has been an important element in the current Maldives-China comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership. Under the BRI, we have received development assistance in housing and infrastructure, including roads, bridges and highways. One landmark project, among others, is the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge, a game-changing development that significantly enhances travel between islands of the capital city, improves the daily lives of Maldivians and enabled greater economic activities. The bridge, the first cross-sea bridge in the Maldives constructed by a Chinese company, connects Male, the Maldivian capital, with neighboring Hulhule Island where the main airport is located, allowing both residents and visitors to travel between the two locations in just five minutes. Serving as a symbol of the strong China-Maldives partnership, the bridge reflects their deep collaboration across infrastructure, trade, and cultural exchanges. I used this bridge on the very first day it was ope"

SO WHAT: If you purchased National Grid securities you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. The Rosen Law Firm is preparing a class action seeking recovery of investor losses. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the prospective class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=41344 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. WHAT IS THIS ABOUT: On July 2, 2025, Reuters published an article entitled “‘Preventable’ National Grid failures led to Heathrow fire, findings say.” The article stated that a “fire that shut London’s Heathrow airport in March, stranding thousands of people, was caused by the UK power grid’s failure to maintain an electricity substation, an official report said on Wednesday, prompting the energy watchdog to open a probe.” Further, the article stated that the United Kingdom’s Energy minister, Ed Miliband, had “called the report “deeply concerning”, after it concluded that the issue which caused the fire was identified seven years ago but went unaddressed by power grid operator National Grid[.]” On this news, National Grid’s American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) fell 5%, on July 2, 2024. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions.

    "content": "Sydney, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SUTHERLAND SHIRE, NSW - October 21, 2025 -  - Hyspec Homes , a residential building company recognised for its high-specification construction and community-based reputation, has announced the expansion of its custom home building services into Wollongong and additional parts of Greater Sydney. The move marks a significant step in broadening access to bespoke home design and construction for families and investors seeking tailored residential solutions. With more than 25 years of combined experience, Hyspec Homes has become a trusted name in the Sutherland Shire, delivering projects ranging from full custom builds to extensions, duplexes, and major renovations. The company's expansion into Wollongong and surrounding suburbs reflects growing demand for locally managed, high-quality home building services that meet the specific needs of communities in both coastal and suburban regions. The Illawarra region, in particular, has seen sustained population growth and residential development over the past decade. With a unique combination of coastal conditions and council planning requirements, the area demands builders with not only technical capability but also a strong understanding of zoning, permits, and long-term resilience in construction. By extending services into Wollongong, Hyspec Homes aims to bring the same high standards of design, craftsmanship, and transparency that have shaped its reputation in the Shire. Brett Anderson, Director of Hyspec Homes, highlighted the importance of this development for both the business and the communities it will serve. \"The decision to expand into Wollongong and additional Sydney suburbs comes after years of working closely with families in the Sutherland Shire and recognising similar needs in nearby regions. Homeowners are looking for builders who can balance design aspirations with practical knowledge of local regulations and site challenges. Our goal has always been to provide a bu"

WHAT IS THIS ABOUT: On June 28, 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission published a release entitled “SEC Charges Consensys Software for Unregistered Offers and Sales of Securities Through Its MetaMask Staking Service.” The release further stated that “since at least January 2023, Consensys has offered and sold tens of thousands of unregistered securities on behalf of liquid staking program providers Lido and Rocket Pool, who create and issue liquid staking tokens (called stETH and rETH) in exchange for staked assets.” Further, the release stated that while “staked tokens are generally locked up and cannot be traded or used while they are staked, liquid staking tokens, as the name implies, can be bought and sold freely. Investors in these staking programs provided funds to Lido and Rocket Pool in exchange for the liquid tokens. The SEC’s complaint alleges that Consensys engages in the unregistered offer and sale of securities by participating in the distribution of the staking programs and operates as an unregistered broker with respect to these transactions.” WHY ROSEN LAW: We encoura"

As part of the collaboration, the network will initially manage 73,000 endpoints across Metro Manila with plans for a multi-year expansion. The collaboration is a key component of Meralco’s smart grid modernization program and marks a significant step toward enhancing customer satisfaction.

Intelligent Connectivity provides an open, IPv6-based network that leverages Gen5 mesh and cellular networking and supports not only smart metering but also a wide range of grid edge and smart city applications. For Meralco, the AMI deployment is an important part of its thrust toward a smarter, more responsive electricity system that transforms how electricity is delivered, measured and managed for the utility’s more than eight (8) million customers. The solution includes several key Itron components that work together to ensure seamless communication, data management and control across Meralco’s service territory. They work together to provide the utility with: Improved operational efficiency through centralized headend system (HES) for control and visibility over endpoints, delivered by UtilityIQ ® software Near real-time data exchange between field devices and back-end systems, enabled by Access Points Reliable and resilient data transmission across the service territory, supported by Network Interface Cards (NICs) , which are meter agnostic and compatible with multiple meter vendors.

    "content": "King of Prussia, Pa., Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biotechnology company Alector announced today that the drug, latozinemab, failed to meet the criteria for safety and efficacy in a Phase 3 clinical trial. The study investigated the drug as an intervention for cases of FTD caused by a variant of the gene GRN. Three genes, GRN , MAPT , and C9orf72 , cause the majority of genetic FTD—itself roughly 20% of FTD cases. “Even though this trial shows that latozinemab is not the treatment FTD- GRN families had hoped for, it represents a major step forward as the first trial of its kind for the FTD field. We must—and will—continue  to support clinical research, knowing that each trial increases our knowledge of FTD and inspires the hope that a future free of FTD is within sight,” said Susan L-J Dickinson, AFTD CEO. In some families, FTD is caused by inherited variations in the GRN gene that impedes the ability of the body to produce progranulin (PRGN), a protein that aids in cell survival and helps regulate inflammation. Lowered levels of PRGN are associated with neurodegeneration. Latozinemab works by inhibiting a receptor that causes the natural degradation of PRGN. In the clinical trial, treatment with latozinemab did result in a significant increase in the levels of plasma PGRN. However, the treatment did not slow progression of disease as measured by the clinical co-primary endpoint, a common clinical assessment referenced by the acronym CDR plus NACC FTLD-SB. Biological markers of disease progression were also unaffected, such as fluid biomarkers and volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (vMRI). Treatment appeared to be safe, with no increased risk of adverse events during the trial. Alector was developing the drug in collaboration with the biopharmaceuticals firm GSK. Phase 3 is the largest and most critical phase in evaluating new treatments before they can be approved for public use. With the results announced today, Alector has concluded the study.  Based on"

The NCIB will be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the TSX and applicable securities laws, with purchases to be made as appropriate opportunities arise from time to time. Anthea Bath, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “The introduction of a normal course issuer bid, subject to TSX approval, reflects the continued strength of Wesdome’s balance sheet and our commitment to disciplined capital allocation.

Wesdome has filed a notice of intention with the TSX to implement an NCIB. If the NCIB is approved by the TSX, Wesdome will be authorized to acquire up to a maximum of 2% of the public float for cancellation over a period of 12 months. Wesdome had a total of 150,969,214 issued and outstanding Shares as of October 16, 2025.

Il s’agissait de la première année complète du programme en tant qu’initiative permanente, à la suite de l’implantation du plan de Responsabilité élargie des producteurs (REP) pour le secteur agricole, entré en vigueur en juin 2023. Ces résultats records sont une excellente façon de souligner la Semaine de la réduction des déchets. Depuis cette date, presque tous les plastiques et emballages utilisés à la ferme sont visés par le programme, incluant les plastiques de fenaison, les sacs (y compris pour l’alimentation animale), tous les contenants, le plastique acéricole et les produits périmés et sur une base volontaire les médicaments (programme en collaboration avec l’Institut canadien de la santé animal). Des résultats au-delà des attentes L’année 2024 a permis à AgriRÉCUP de consolider son réseau, optimiser ses opérations et élargir ses services, entraînant des résultats bien au-delà des attentes initiales : 4,2 millions de kg de plastiques agricoles récupérés, comparativement à 2,9 millions en 2023; 62 % d’augmentation pour la récupération de films agricoles et de ficelles, atteignant un total de 2,37 millions de kg; 28 % de hausse pour la tubulure acéricole, atteignant 733 000 kg récupérés; 191 sites de collecte actifs à travers le Québec, facilitant l’accès au service pour les producteurs; Des ententes signées avec la majorité des municipalités et MRC agricoles, assurant un maillage local efficace. Des partenariats locaux, des retombées concrètes AgriRÉCUP mise sur la collaboration locale pour donner une seconde vie aux plastiques agricoles : Soutien à l'économie circulaire locale : AgriRÉCUP privilégie les petites entreprises québécoises, y compris une dizaine de transporteurs locaux saisonniers, pour assurer la logistique, le transport"

    "content": "NEW YORK, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, continues to investigate potential securities claims on behalf of shareholders of Designer Brands Inc. (NYSE: DBI) resulting from allegations that Designer Brands may have issued materially misleading business information to the investing public. SO WHAT: If you purchased Designer Brands securities you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. The Rosen Law Firm is preparing a class action seeking recovery of investor losses. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the prospective class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=40581 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. WHAT IS THIS ABOUT: On June 10, 2025, Designer Brands reported its financial results for the first quarter of 2025. Commenting on the results, Designer Brands’ CEO stated that “[w]e experienced a soft start to 2025 amid an unpredictable macro environment and deteriorating consumer sentiment.” Further, the CEO stated that “[g]iven the persistent instability and pressure on consumer discretionary spend, we’ve made the decision to withdraw our 2025 guidance for the time being.” On this news, Designer Brands’ stock fell 18.2% on June 10, 2025. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. At the time "

    "content": "BURNABY, British Columbia, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Starbucks workers at Cloverdale’s Clover Square Village in Surrey, B.C., are the latest to join a growing movement of baristas across Canada who are standing together for fairness, respect and better working conditions. The United Steelworkers union (USW) proudly welcomes these workers as they take an important step toward building a stronger future at Starbucks. The Clover Square Village baristas organized in response to concerns about job security, staffing levels and fairness at work. But above all, they organized for a stronger voice to have a say in the decisions that affect their daily lives. “With all the changes and new job requirements that are being routinely introduced by our new CEO, we are finding it more and more difficult to meet the high expectations of Starbucks,” said a Clover Square Village worker. “There is a level of hypocrisy with corporate bosses claiming they are ‘committed to our health and well-being’ while simultaneously not giving us enough staff on the floor to meet those unrealistic demands. This has resulted in mental burnout for employees and increasing frustration for our customers. With the recent closures of many North American stores and the severance of over 900 partners, many of us are now experiencing job insecurity. We are worried about losing our jobs and benefits.” Beyond the stress and uncertainty, workers say their struggles are building from a lack of respect and accountability from management. “As partners, we’ve raised multiple concerns with management about our basic human rights, including the right to self-expression, to a workplace free from bullying and harassment and to be treated with respect and dignity,” said another worker from Clover Square Village. “Despite our efforts, our concerns continue to be dismissed. We’re told to turn the other cheek and prioritize others’ comfort, even when it means compromising our own safety and self-worth. We believe"

The multi-day event brought together prominent civil-justice attorneys, judges, and policymakers to address systemic inequities and celebrate diversity in mass-tort and consumer-protection law. Co-Founders: Ben Crump  (left) - Fu Debrosse (Right) Championing Representation in Consumer Justice In the interview, Perras explained that Shades of Mass was founded to strengthen representation for communities of color in major civil-litigation cases. “Black and brown communities have historically borne the brunt of corporate misconduct—faulty products, environmental hazards, and systemic neglect—yet are under-represented in the courtroom,” said Perras. SOM’s mission is to empower more Black and Brown attorneys to lead mass-tort and consumer-justice cases, ensuring balanced representation while holding corporations and insurers accountable.

    "content": "WASHINGTON, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, the U.S. Small Business Administration released a state-level analysis of how small businesses have been impacted by the federal shutdown, which has frozen the agency’s core 7(a) and 504 small business lending programs. For fiscal year 2025 (FY25), the SBA guaranteed a record 84,400 loans, reaching $45 billion in capital for Main Street. Each business day the shutdown continues, an estimated 320 small businesses nationwide are unable to access $170 million in SBA-backed commercial loans, translating to $2.5 billion which has been blocked from 4,800 small businesses so far over the course of the shutdown. The loan programs are funded by lender fees and operate at zero subsidy, or zero cost, to taxpayers. “Thanks to President Trump’s agenda to reduce taxes, regulation and unfair trade deals, small business optimism is at seven-year highs, resulting in the SBA serving a record 85,000 job creators with $45 billion in federally-backed loans – supporting historic hiring, expansion, and confidence on Main Street,” said SBA Administrator Kelly Loeffler. “Senate Democrats have decided to cut off that momentum and that capital for Main Street, in favor of growing government spending by $1.5 trillion and blocking a clean funding bill to reopen the government. With the SBA’s loan programs shuttered, thousands of small businesses are now unable to access the vital funding they need to survive, let alone thrive – and will soon begin cutting hours and benefits, laying off workers, and contemplating closing up shop for good.” Below is the SBA analysis by state for the weekly impact on SBA-guaranteed loans: State # of SBA Loans Not Approved (per week) $ Value of SBA Loan Proceeds Blocked (per week) California 212 $126,885,142 Texas 128 $88,976,933 Florida 135 $76,862,958 New York 106 $40,067,129 Georgia 49 $34,619,694 Illinois 60 $31,284,460 Colorado 46 $26,411,206 Ohio 67 $26,267,104 Pennsylvania 54 $25,961,288 New Jersey 56 $2"

OFAL’s management has observed that the company’s share price temporarily fell below USD 1.00, likely due to broader market conditions and external macroeconomic factors. Management emphasizes that there are no operational issues within the company, as all business activities continue to progress in an orderly and stable manner. Management firmly believes that the current market capitalization does not fully reflect OFAL’s intrinsic value. At an appropriate and compliant time, the company intends to conduct a share buyback in the public market. In conjunction with this statement, OFAL’s management provides the following summary of the company’s strategic business model and ongoing development. Four Core Business Platforms: Mutually Reinforcing and Interconnected Architectural Design and Project Management Platform OFA Group focuses on architectural design and integrated project management, offering services from conceptual design and construction documentation to on-site supervision. The platform unites an international network of architects and professional consultants, leveraging digital workflows to enhance efficiency, reduce design errors, and lower project costs.

    "content": "SAN JOSE, Calif., Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- VDE Americas, a global leader in technical advisory and catastrophic risk assessment services for the solar industry, today announced the internationalization of its innovative hail risk assessment and mitigation services. Since 2021, VDE Americas has offered location- and technology-specific financial hail risk exposure reports to solar project developers, owners, financiers, and insurers operating in the most hail-exposed region in the world—the continental United States. After supporting increased customer demand in Australia, Europe, the Middle East, and South Africa, the company has formalized the global expansion of its hail risk assessment service territory. Severe convective storms—a meteorological category that produces tornadoes, high winds, and damaging hail—account for tens of billions of U.S. dollars of insured losses worldwide each year. As solar project deployments have increased in size, frequency, and geographic distribution, financial losses specifically due to hailstorm damage have risen in parallel. According to GCube, a specialty insurer with an international book of business, hail accounts for less than 2% of solar project insurance claims by count—but more than 50% of total financial losses. Since 2018, hail-related solar losses in the state of Texas alone have exceeded $600 million. Originally developed to de-risk capital investments in utility-scale solar, VDE Hail Risk Intelligence provides state-of-the-art hail severity and frequency forecasts to support engineered financial loss assessments and risk mitigation responses. Because severe hail hotspots occur globally, VDE Americas leveraged its longstanding collaboration with Dr. John Allen, a professor of meteorology at Central Michigan University, to develop state-of-the-art data analysis and transposition tools capable of characterizing hailstorm frequency and severity anywhere in the world, the results of which can be applied to any i"

The initiative demonstrates how existing endpoint hardware can be securely repurposed to meet strict DoW network access controls, reduce operational complexity, and accelerate time-to-compliance in mission-critical environments. Mission Assurance Through Endpoint Control Working with NDU, the team implemented a controlled, policy-driven device program designed to pass rigorous DoW C2C posture checks, enforce workload segregation, and integrate Zero Trust policy enforcement at the endpoint. Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) served as the policy decision point, delivering identity validation, posture validation, and continuous monitoring endpoint compliance. IGEL’s immutable, read-only endpoint OS — centrally orchestrated by the Universal Management Suite (UMS) — provided the trusted endpoint architecture that minimized the attack surface, enforced configuration integrity, and eliminated local data storage. Together, ISE and UMS created an end-to-end trust chain — where UMS ensured endpoint compliance and ISE continuously verified it before granting or maintaining network access to the endpoint. Through standards-based API integration, Cisco ISE pxGrid Direct integration dynamically queried UMS for enrollment, configuration, and real-time compliance status. Once requirements were met, ISE automatically applied network policies — including segmentation, Security Group Tagging (SGT), and VLAN assignments — granting mission-ready access to compliant devices and restrictin"

Production for the quarter totaled 2.24 million pounds of copper and 1,906 ounces of gold in concentrates, a decrease of 23% for copper and 8% for gold, respectively, over the same period in 2024. “During the period, higher metal prices enabled profitable mining of ore from lower mine zones previously excluded from reserves, leading to a quarterly revision of the mine plan to incorporate this out-of-reserve material. These areas of the deposit are in the final months and are being prioritized to maximize overall ore recovery. The lower grade, newly converted reserves, offset the contribution from the higher-grade upper zones, which percentage of feed to the mill has been consistently increasing as development continues and more stopes enter production. Given the change in the mine plan, results for the quarter were below budget, in particular for the copper head grade, which increased from the previous quarter but not as much as initially forecasted,” stated Fernando E. Ganoza, CEO. “We anticipate production for the following quarter will improve driven by higher copper head grade, even though we will continue to maximize ore recovery in the lower zones, as this strategy, coupled with the current drill program, should help us increase the reserves and the life of mine.” Third Quarter Operational Highlights Production of 2.24 million pounds of copper contained in concentrates; a decrease of 23% over Q3 2024. Production of 1,906 ounces of gold contained in concentrates; a decrease of 8% over Q3 2024. Average processed tonnes per day of 741, a decrease of 3% over Q3 2024.

Click here to participate in the action. NEW YORK, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- What’s Happening: Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C ., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, is investigating potential claims against PubMatic, Inc. (NASDAQ:PUBM) on behalf of long-term stockholders following a class action complaint that was filed against PubMatic on August 20, 2025 with a Class Period from February 27, 2025 to August 11, 2025. Our investigation concerns whether the board of directors of PubMatic have breached their fiduciary duties to the company. Details: The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that a top DSP buyer was shifting a significant number of clients to a new platform which evaluated inventory differently; (2) that, as a result, PubMatic was seeing a reduction in ad spend and revenue from this top DSP buyer; and (3) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On August 11, 2025, after the market closed, PubMatic released its second quarter 2025 financial report. In its report, PubMatic’s Chief Financial Officer, Steven Pantelick, revealed that the Company’s outlook reflects “a reduction in ad spend from one of [its] top DSP partners.”"

    "content": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading AI-powered cryptocurrency trading tool CoinTech2u announced today that its proprietary AI system successfully navigated the recent crypto market crash, earning its users over $1.3 million in profit even as the market suffered massive losses. Bull Runs Before Spooked Swans Bitcoin (BTC), the original and one of the most expensive cryptocurrencies, was soaring to new all-time highs — surpassing $126,000 USD just a week ago on 8 October 2025. Market sentiment was overwhelmingly bullish as capital poured into digital assets. Strong institutional ETF inflows, rising on-chain transfer volumes, and robust derivatives market activity all signalled a healthy and expanding market structure — with analysts projecting even higher gains ahead (Nasdaq, 2025) . Yet just three days later, on 11 October 2025 , the crypto market was hit by one of the sharpest drawdowns in recent history. Without warning, the global market crashed, with Bitcoin plunging 19.56% , falling below $102,000 USD within hours of the aggressive tariff announcement by U.S. President Donald Trump — including 100% tariffs on Chinese exports and new export controls on rare earth minerals. ( Reuters, 2025 ). Bitcoin dropped from $126,173 to $101,482 (OKX Bitcoin Chart) Major altcoins recorded even steeper, double-digit declines: ETH dropped 16%, XRP, SOL, and DOGE fell between 20–30%, while ADA, LINK, and AAVE crashed by as much as 40% ( CoinDesk, 2025 ). This volatility triggered more than $3 billion in crypto liquidations within an hour and over $19 billion within 24 hours , marking one of the largest market wipeouts in crypto history, involving over 1.6 million traders ( CoinGlass, 2025 ). +9.8% net profit during market crash — CoinTech2u trade on OKX (Equity Chart) CoinTech2u’s AI Stands Strong Amid st the Storm Despite the unprecedented black swan event, CoinTech2u’s AI analysed the market in real time and adjusted its strategy automatica"

    "content": "Florida City, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In the wake of growing political and economic uncertainty in the United States, DeLeion Capital , a leading global digital asset management firm, has announced the official launch of its Ethereum (ETH) Digital Asset Custody Service, a next-generation solution designed to combine institutional-grade security with sustainable yield generation. The announcement comes at a critical time for global markets. This disruption has delayed approvals for multiple digital asset products, including Litecoin (LTC) ETF, which expired without a final decision. These developments have intensified anxiety, contributing to a significant downturn in the market. Over the past weeks, digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Litecoin (LTC), Solana (SOL), and TRON (TRX) have experienced heightened volatility and over $19 billion in liquidations. Amid these challenges, individuals are increasingly turning to secure custody and managed investment options to protect and grow their portfolios. DeLeion Capital’s Strategic Response: Secure ETH Custody: Against this backdrop, DeLeion Capital has introduced its Ethereum Digital Asset Custody Service a professionally managed, secure, and transparent platform that allows investors to safely store ETH while earning regular, optimized returns. The service leverages enterprise-grade security architecture, multi-signature verification , and smart contract-based governance, ensuring full transparency and reliability in every custody operation. “Periods of macroeconomic instability often accelerate innovation in finance,” said Roger M. Lambdin, CMO of DeLeion Capital. “Our Ethereum custody solution is designed to provide investors with stability, flexibility, and yield generation, all within a fully compliant and secure framework. It’s an intelligent alternative for those seeking predictable returns without sacrificing control of their digital assets.” Key Features of the Ethereum Digital"

Although treatment resulted in a statistically significant effect on the biomarker co-primary endpoint of plasma progranulin (PGRN) concentrations, the secondary and exploratory endpoints, such as fluid biomarkers and volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (vMRI), demonstrated no treatment-related effects on FTD- GRN . Preliminary safety data have not highlighted any major safety concerns at present. More in-depth analysis of the data is ongoing. “While latozinemab did not demonstrate a clinical benefit in INFRONT-3, the insights gained are invaluable for understanding progranulin-related neurodegeneration,\" said Giacomo Salvadore, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Alector. \"We extend our deepest gratitude to the patients, caregivers, and investigators who made this trial possible, and we plan to share the results with the scientific community to support continued progress in understanding progranulin biology and FTD pathophysiology.” Based on these results, the open-label extension portion of the INFRONT-3 trial and the continuation study for latozinemab will be discontinued. The INFRONT-3 trial results will be presented at an upcoming medical congress. Alector Pipeline Outlook Alector remains focused on advancing a pipelin"

(“Terns” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: TERN), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a portfolio of small-molecule product candidates to address serious diseases, including oncology and obesity, today announced topline 12-week results from its Phase 2 trial of TERN-601, a novel, once-daily, oral GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) as a potential treatment for obesity. “The threshold for a truly differentiated oral GLP-1RA therapy – one that delivers safety, tolerability and efficacy – is high. The Phase 2 topline 12-week results for TERN-601 did not meet this threshold and likely preclude further development,” said Amy Burroughs, chief executive officer of Terns. “As we’ve previously communicated, we do not plan to further invest in metabolic disease. Our team remains energized and focused on advancing our potentially best-in-class TERN-701 program in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with our full capabilities. We look forward to announcing new data from our Phase 1 CARDINAL trial of TERN-701 for CML this quarter.” “We would like to thank all the trial participants, investigators, caregivers, clinical sites, and Terns team members for their support and involvement in this well-run Phase 2 trial,” said Emil Kuriakose, M.D., chief medical officer of Terns. “The results of our previous Phase 1 inpatient 28-day trial did not translate to those we observed in this 12-week trial, which was con"

Net income for the third quarter of 2025 was $22.1 million, or $0.73 per diluted share, compared with $15.1 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2025. The return on average assets for the third quarter of 2025 was 1.12% and the return on average equity was 10.69%, compared with a return on average assets of 0.79% and a return on average equity of 7.48% for the second quarter of 2025. CEO Commentary “Hanmi delivered outstanding third quarter results, which highlights the strength of our enduring franchise,” said Bonnie Lee, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our net interest margin expanded by 15 basis points to 3.22% and preprovision net revenue increased 16.4% quarter-over-quarter driven by robust growth in net interest income and well-managed expenses. As a result, we generated a return on average equity of 10.69%.” “Loan growth was healthy, supported by loan production of $571 million, up 73% from the prior quarter with a strong contribution coming from commercial loans. Our ongoing investments in our commercial lending teams, the USKC initiative and expansion into new markets, helped drive production for this key asset class. These investments also contributed to a 2.4% annualized increase in deposits, with noninterest-bearing demand deposits holding steady at approximately 31% of total deposits.” “Importantly, our excellent credit quality improved further with reductions in criticized loans and nonperforming assets. This progress reflects our comprehensive and proactive asset management practices, as well as our conservative credit underwriting culture.” “As we look ahead, we’re energized by the momentum and strength across all aspects of our business.

Her participation underscores growing global recognition of NurExone’s leadership in developing exosome therapies and in helping define the regulatory path for this emerging field. Dr. Sarel will present “Regulatory Challenges in the Clinical Development of ExoPTEN: MSC EVs Loaded with PTEN-siRNA” on October 28, followed by a panel discussion on how developers of exosome therapeutics can better approach regulatory approval. The invitation reflects strong international interest in NurExone’s lead program, ExoPTEN, a drug under development that combines regenerative and anti-inflammatory mechanisms to repair Central Nervous System damage. “The Orphan Drug Designation granted to ExoPTEN in acute spinal cord injury opened the door to early and constructive discussions with the FDA, where we have built an open, data-driven relationship focused on both innovation and patient safety,” said Dr. Ina Sarel, Director of Clinical and Regulatory Affairs at NurExone. ExoPTEN is designed to address significant unmet needs and critical indications in central nervous system repair, including acute spinal cord injury and optic nerve damage associated with glaucoma. In both indications, ExoPTEN has demonstrated the ability to restore nerve function and reduce inflammation in preclinical models. “Leading industry and regulatory stakeholders are following NurExone’s progress closely, and we are glad to present our work in Cambridge,” said Dr. Lior Shaltiel, CEO of NurExone. “Our strategy combines scientific innovation with regulatory leadership, paving the way for exosome-based therapie"

Estimates show that only 5% of adults with Down syndrome in the United States have access to clinics specifically equipped to meet their unique healthcare needs. Most individuals rely on primary care professionals who often have limited experience with the Down syndrome community and may have received minimal training in medical school on how to provide appropriate care. To close this critical knowledge gap and improve healthcare outcomes, NDSS created CARE Down Syndrome in partnership with more than 40 national experts, including Brian Chicoine, MD, Medical Director of Advocate Medical Group Adult Down Syndrome Center, and with support from The Linda and Mike Mussallem Foundation. This initiative extends Dr. Chicoine’s and others’ vital research and expertise to primary care professionals worldwide. CARE Down Syndrome Initiative Highlights: Accredited eLearning Course: The initiative features a two-hour, self-paced eLearning course designed to help healthcare professionals learn practical strategies for managing the unique healthcare needs of adults with Down syndrome, while earning Continuing Medical Education (CME) credits. Reference Articles : CARE Down Syndrome offers a free catalog of reference articles, providing clinically relevant, quick-access information and tools on a range of topics, including Alzheimer’s disease, weight management, and mental health. Specialized Resource Library : The resource library includes patient education materials and additional tools designed to support healthcare professionals in delivering exceptional care to adults with Down syndrome.

The company stated that over the next three years it will continue to increase the proportion of its investments across countries and regions worldwide to respond to the rapid growth in global demand for AI computing power. Since its founding in 2020, JLK Capital Management Ltd. has focused on providing technology-driven, long-term asset-allocation solutions for institutions and high-net-worth clients. Unlike traditional financial investments, JLK Capital places its emphasis on high-performance computing (HPC) and GPU-cluster infrastructure to support the development of artificial intelligence, big-data analytics, and cloud-computing ecosystems. According to the company’s management, with the surge in demand for generative AI, machine learning, and in-house model training, the global shortage of GPU servers has become a core factor driving the upgrade of the technology industry. By investing in and operating GPU compute centers, JLK Capital provides infrastructure support for AI companies while achieving long-term, stable asset returns. “We believe compute is the productive force of the future,” — said the head of strategy at JLK Capital Management Ltd. in a statement. “Our goal is to build a sustainable, scalable AI compute investment network that enables long-term win-wins between capital and technology at the foundational layer.” JLK Capital has established data-center nodes in Colorado and Texas in the United States, as well as in Singapore, and has begun cooperating with multiple cloud-computing and chip-manufacturing companies.

    "content": "MIDDLETOWN, Conn., Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- October marks Menopause Awareness Month, a time to focus on the physical and emotional changes that affect more than 1 million American women each year. Fairhaven Health , a leader in women’s reproductive and hormonal wellness, is spotlighting two evidence-based supplements that address the unmet needs of women navigating menopause: Complete Menopause Relief and Menopause Multivitamin Essentials . Despite growing awareness, menopause remains an area with limited innovation. Many available supplements rely solely on single ingredients, such as rhubarb extract, without addressing the full range of menopausal symptoms or underlying biological systems. Fairhaven Health’s approach goes further, combining clinically studied ingredients that support hormonal balance, mood, sleep, and overall well-being without hormones. Complete Menopause Relief is formulated with rhapontic rhubarb and copaiba extract, offering comprehensive, hormone-free relief for the most common symptoms, including hot flashes, night sweats, and mood fluctuations. While rhubarb binds primarily to beta estrogen receptors, copaiba interacts with both alpha and beta receptors as well as the CB2 receptors of the endocannabinoid system—an area increasingly recognized for its role in stress response and mood regulation. The unique botanical formulation provides a broad and complete targeting of the ER alpha and ER beta receptors, balanced CB1 and CB2 activation, along with modulation of the NK3R receptor supporting advanced temperature control—all providing for a more complete and balanced response. “Women deserve solutions informed by the latest science, giving them real, comprehensive support instead of relying on outdated formulas,” said Meagan Purdy , naturopathic doctor, brand manager and educator at Blueroot Health , the parent company of Fairhaven Health. “By pairing copaiba with rhapontic rhubarb, we’re supporting the body’s natural communication "

    "content": "Austin, TX, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Cicero Institute applauds Gov. Greg Abbott's announcement today that he is \"dedicated to making Austin safer and cleaner by relocating homeless individuals and removing encampments in and around the capital city and state property.\" Texas is moving decisively to address, with compassion, the city's humanitarian crisis. Once cleared, encampment sites are being cleaned, and homeless individuals are being redirected to safe shelters where they can receive services. Recent polling shows a bipartisan majority of Texans support these types of strong action. \"Gov. Abbott has answered the White House's call for states to take back our cities from the crime and disorder permitted by misguided progressive policies,\" said Cicero's Public Safety Policy Director Devon Kurtz . \"Enforcement is an essential step towards not only cleaning up our streets, but getting the most vulnerable homeless away from predatory drug markets and connected to the help and support they need.\" The operation, which began late last week, reports having cleared 48 encampments, more than 3,000 pounds of debris, and seized more than 125 grams of narcotics. It also identified 10 individuals with outstanding warrants and arrested 24 repeat felony offenders. \"Texans should not endure public safety risks from homeless encampments and individuals,\" said Gov. Abbott. \"Weapons, needles, and other debris should not litter the streets of our community, and the State of Texas is taking action. I directed state agencies to address this risk and make Austin safer and cleaner for residents and visitors to live, travel, and conduct business.\" About the Cicero Institute: The Cicero Institute designs and promotes public policies that solve some of America's toughest challenges. Our homelessness work is focused on actionable research that empowers lawmakers to build healthier, safer communities."

    "content": "Dubai, UAE, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ChillPlay Games today announced a significant milestone for its mobile title Over Hit: Hero Fight , which has surpassed 50,000 downloads on Google Play. Coinciding with this momentum, the studio released a major technical update that rebuilds the game from the ground up on a modular engine architecture based on Unity 6 and debuts AI Node, a new in-house module currently in beta. AI Node is powered by Claude AI by Anthropic and leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) during the game assembly process to deliver smarter enemies and more coherent level design. The  latest release represents a comprehensive re-platforming focused on  performance, maintainability, and faster content iteration. By adopting a  modular approach with Unity 6, the development team has separated  gameplay systems into discrete components, enabling safer updates and  quicker experimentation without destabilizing core loops. This  foundation is intended to reduce technical debt over time and support  frequent feature drops that can respond to community feedback. At the heart of the update is AI Node, which integrates Claude AI and MCP to enrich decision-making for non-player characters and streamline level authoring. During build time, AI Node can evaluate enemy behaviors, encounter pacing, and environmental affordances, then propose targeted adjustments that designers review and incorporate. The result is enemy squads that adapt more intelligently to player tactics, as well as levels that guide players through clearer risk-reward choices while preserving the game’s fast, arcade-style combat. “Reaching 50,000 downloads is an important milestone for ChillPlay Games,” said Aleksejs Misarins, CEO & Founder of ChillPlay Games. “The team aims to keep pace with the latest innovations in interactive entertainment, and integrating AI into our production pipeline is a priority for any technology-driven business. With AI Node, powered by Claude AI and MCP,"

The company executed critical storm restoration services in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina, working to reconnect millions to the power grid and provide essential aid in hard-hit communities. Delivering power and hope — Jake Meeks and the Premium Utility Contractor team providing generators to families in need after the storms. Premium Utility Contractor leveraged its strategic network of laydown yards and specialized equipment, including off-road machinery and swamp buggies, to navigate extensive flooding and destruction. Crews worked tirelessly, often in partnership with local authorities, to bypass impassable roads and reconnect millions of people to the energy grid. Beyond the massive infrastructure repair, Premium Utility Contractor demonstrated a profound commitment to community welfare. In Tampa, the company went above and beyond its core mission, partnering with local law enforcement and the non-profit Grey Bull to assist in civilian rescue operations using airboats and other vehicles. Furthermore, the company generously donated 20 generators to families struggling without power, prioritizing those with medical conditions and infants. The scale and complexity of the operation required meticulous planning and execution, spearheaded by key leadership. Jake Meeks, a central figure in the company's emergency response, underscored the organization's dedication. \"Our teams at Premium Utility Contractor were prepared and executed a flawless plan, first wrapping up one hurricane response and immediately pivoting to face Helene and Milton,\" said Jake Meeks. \"Our commitment goes beyond simply fixing lines; it's about helping people and giving back to the communities where we "

The 26 th annual Lights On Afterschool , organized again this year by the Afterschool Alliance , will include student showcases and performances, academic contests, student films, art displays, walks and runs, STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) demonstrations, discussions, visits from public officials, open houses, and more as programs showcase the skills students hone and the talents they develop at their afterschool programs. Superstar USHER is Honorary Chair of Lights On Afterschool again this year. From Niagara Falls in upstate New York to the Frederick Douglass Bridge in Washington, D.C. to Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, and in many other places, buildings, bridges, and other landmarks will be lit in yellow and blue for afterschool this week. A representative sample of Lights On Afterschool events around the country is here . To find more events, see this map . Lights On Afterschool this year comes as federal funding for afterschool is uncertain. A massive public outcry in July led the Trump Administration to release – rather than withhold – the FY2025 funds Congress had appropriated for 21st Century Community Learning Centers, the chief federal funding stream for afterschool and summer learning programs. But the Administration has recommended defunding the program in this fiscal year; Congress has yet to finalize the FY2026 budget. According to a 2025 study , the parents of 29.6 million children, more than half the school-age kids in the country, want afterschool programs for their children – but less than 7 million are currently enrolled.

The partnership secures Midway’s local legacy while positioning the company for continued growth and service to the community for decades to come. Rush, who grew up in Springfield, Missouri, around her family’s small roofing business, was drawn to Midway for its reputation for craftsmanship, integrity and deep community roots. After earning her MBA from Harvard Business School and advising companies nationwide as a management consultant at McKinsey, Savannah wanted to bring her experience home to Missouri. “Growing up around small businesses, I’ve always believed that the most meaningful work happens when people take care of their neighbors and their employees,” said Rush. “I’m proud to be partnering with Brandon and Michele to build on what they’ve created, and to be part of the next generation of women helping drive growth in the trades.” Founded in 2001, Midway Electric has grown from a small, family-run operation into one of the region’s most respected providers of residential and commercial electrical services. Brandon Spry said the partnership ensures Midway’s long-term future while preserving its local focus. “From the start, it was clear Savannah cared deeply about our people and our customers,” said Brandon Spry. “She understands that Midway’s strength has always been our reputation for doing the right thing. We’re confident that under her leadership, Midway will continue to grow while staying true to what has always made us special.” Michele Spry added that the partnership represents both continuity and progress: “We’ve always taken pride in serving Mid-Missouri with honesty and heart,” she said. “Savannah brings that same spirit, along with new ideas and ener"

    "content": "WILLIAMS LAKE, British Columbia, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Williams Lake First Nation (WLFN) announced today the re-release of the St. Joseph’s Mission (SJM) Indian Residential School and Onward Ranch Investigation: Interim Report of Findings as part of its continued work toward truth, healing, and revitalization at the former St. Joseph’s Mission site. The Interim Report will soon be available for wider public access through Kindle, Apple Books, and OverDrive at participating public libraries across Canada. “This work is heavy. It’s emotional. But it’s also sacred,” said Chief Willie Sellars. “The investigation has brought painful truths to light, and we are re-releasing our interim report to ensure those truths are never forgotten. Our community has come so far, but we can’t do this alone. Healing the land, and the people connected to it, will take sustained commitment and real investment from all levels of government.” WLFN underscores that uncovering truth must be matched with tangible, sustained investments in healing. Survivors, intergenerational survivors, and families need safe spaces to gather, reflect, process grief, and receive cultural, spiritual, and mental wellness supports—on their own terms. Continued partnership from all levels of government will be essential to ensuring this work leads not only to answers, but to lasting healing and justice. In anticipation of the re-release of the Interim Report , WLFN invites all Canadians to read the report, sit with its truths, and stand with the Nation in ensuring that this work leads not only to answers—but to action, healing, and justice. The findings of the Interim Report represent one step in a much longer journey—a journey that requires care, courage, and meaningful support. WLFN would like to acknowledge that information regarding Indian Residential Schools could be triggering for some people. A crisis support line at the Indian Residential School Survivors Society can be reached at 1-866-925-4"

    "content": "Singapore, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Abellé , a new faith-inspired jewelry brand, has launched its debut collection of intricately crafted enamel cross necklaces on Kickstarter, inviting believers to wear their faith boldly and joyfully . Model wearing Abellé’s “Dawn” necklace, featuring hand-painted flowers and birds. The name Abellé joins the Hebrew idea of “breath” with “belle,” meaning beauty—because everything that has breath is made by God and bears His beauty. Each cross is hand-painted in colored enamel on brass and finished with 18K gold plating , created to be a quiet reminder of how great our God is and how wondrous His works are. With only 99 pieces ever made per design , Abellé encourages wearers to pause, breathe, and notice the beauty of His creation in everyday life. Crafted in His likeness. Abellé’s design philosophy reflects the belief that God is the first craftsman —the One who formed creation with intention and care. In that spirit, every Abellé cross is masterfully painted, brushstroke by brushstroke , so petals, leaves, birds, and branches echo the detail of the Creator’s hand. “With every breath, creation is singing,” says the Abellé team. “Abellé was born from that awe. No two alike—by design. Because each piece is carefully hand-painted, subtle variations make every cross a one-of-a-kind masterpiece—a reminder that each wearer is uniquely made and deeply loved. Every one is a beloved child of God, and the cross we carry is a daily reminder of His love and goodness.” Abellé’s nine debut designs capture the tender details of blooming flowers, birds, branches, and vines —nature’s motifs that mirror His artistry. Supporters who pledge for the complete set will unlock an exclusive mystery piece available only through the campaign. The necklaces make thoughtful gifts for Christmas, baptisms, confirmations, birthdays, and anniversaries —tangible expressions of hope and thanksgiving. The Abellé Kickstarter campaign is more than a product "

    "content": "San Diego, CA, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The rules of digital growth are shifting fast as AI-driven discovery is rewriting how consumers find products and services. Even long-standing giants are feeling the impact. Google's search market share dropped below 90% in Q4 for the first time since 2015.1 At the same time, Gartner projects that organic search traffic could decline by 50% by 2028.2 For brands, this is a signal that old acquisition playbooks are losing their edge. The culprits are clear: customer acquisition costs are rising, platforms are fragmenting, and AI is advancing faster than most teams can adapt. This widening divide between marketing spend and profitable growth is what many in the industry are calling the performance marketing gap. For entrepreneurs and venture-backed founders, the question is no longer whether to spend on marketing. The question is how to do it profitably. Why Cardiff Ventures Invested in The Agency Founded by former Google advertising executive Charleen Kao, The Agency has built a reputation for helping high-growth companies scale efficiently with AI-driven strategies, unified measurement, and full-funnel marketing. Cardiff Ventures sees this partnership as an opportunity to accelerate The Agency's impact, enabling more brands to execute strategies that align marketing spend with real business outcomes. The Agency's approach focuses on three key areas that help brands bridge the performance marketing gap: Cross-Channel Strategy: Full-funnel campaigns designed to align marketing with business goals, not just top-of-funnel metrics. Measurement and Analytics: Unified performance tracking across channels, connecting marketing and sales with clear KPIs and actionable insights. AI/LLM-Driven Performance: Campaign optimization leveraging AI and large language models to improve targeting, creative, and ROI. By combining these elements, The Agency equips brands to move quickly, stay nimble, and make data-driven decisions in an i"

This report is highly relevant now due to the growing demand for curing agents across key industries.

    "content": "Gainesville, Fl., Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gleim Aviation, a strategic leader and provider of aviation training materials, is delighted to announce the renewal of its sponsorship of legendary pilot Vicky Benzing. The partnership demonstrates the continued commitment of Gleim in supporting aviation education, exposing more people to the aviation world, and fostering a diverse pipeline of qualified pilots to help address the pilot shortage. Benzing is a nationally lauded pilot, skydiver, aerobatic performer, and air racer, and a well-known fixture at airshows and aviation events throughout the United States. As a champion for women in aviation and with more than 10,000 hours of flight time, Benzing holds the record for being the fastest woman ever at the National Championship Air Races in Reno, Nevada. Through this collaboration, the Gleim Aviation logo will be proudly displayed on Benzing’s iconic aircraft, leveraging a shared passion to educate and inspire aviation professionals and enthusiasts. “I am thrilled to extend my partnership with Gleim Aviation,” said Vicky Benzing. “It’s been a real privilege to work with a company that shares my passion for aviation and for high-quality education. Together, we hope to inspire and support the next generation of pilots, especially the young women who have so much to contribute to the aviation industry.” Despite growth in other industries, the participation of women in aviation, particularly as pilots, remains low. According to Women in Aviation International , women represented just over 10% of the total pilot population in 2024. Although women in the aviation industry have steadily increased over the past 20 years, the numbers remain lower by comparison with men within the industry. Gleim Aviation hopes a partnership like this will encourage young people, especially women, to envision a career path in the field of aviation. “We are proud to sponsor Vicky and greatly admire her commitment to aviation,” said Glei"

Strategic Objective: The uplisting represents the Company overcoming the last critical obstacle before applying to a national exchange. Future Financing : With nearly $10 million in positive net equity as of today, the Company is positioned to pursue its national exchange listing goals without relying on dilutive financing. Flyte Fleet: The Company has completed the financial turnaround of its $14 million Flyte acquisition and expects its fleet to include three Cirrus Vision Jet SF50 aircraft by the end of fiscal year 2025. NEW YORK, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Creatd, Inc. (OTC: CRTD) today announced that its common shares have been approved to trade on the OTCQB Venture Market. The uplisting is effective tomorrow, October 22, 2025, and the Company’s shares will continue to trade under the ticker symbol “CRTD.” This move marks the Company’s advancement from the OTCID Market to the OTCQB Venture Market and affirms the Company’s ability to deliver on its stated strategic objectives with discipline and consistency. Having once traded on the Nasdaq with a market cap of over $100 million, the company’s return to the OTCQB follows an extensive multi-year effort to rebuild financial strength and corporate infrastructure. That process culminated in the restoration of approximately $10 million in positive net equity as of today, a robust and growing portfolio of tangible assets, multiple acquisitions, and the successful integration of Flyte, valued at $14 million, marking a pivotal expansion of the company’s strategic platform. Today, Flyte represents half the Company’s projected $10 million in annual revenues. Flyte is a true turnaround and a testament to the vision of CRTD. “Rejoining the OTCQB marks the beginning of a new era for Creatd,” said Jeremy Frommer, Chief Executive Officer of Creatd, Inc. “We have cleared the hardest"

The Rosen Law Firm is preparing a class action seeking recovery of investor losses. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the prospective class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=46349 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.

WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles.

At the time Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017.

The Pet Innovation Awards is an independent recognition platform highlighting the most innovative companies, services, and products in the highly competitive Pet care industry. Barkworthies ® Hickory Smoked Bully + Collagen Chews are crafted from a patented combination of bully stick and collagen sourced from ultra-premium first-split beef hide. These dual-layer chews are more digestible than traditional rawhide and deliver added collagen benefits that help with skin, coat, and joint health. The strong, durable chew makes it long-lasting and ideal for heavy chewers. These chews are smoked over real hickory wood using Barkworthies’ patent-pending smoking process. The result is a long-lasting, limited-ingredient chew that’s infused with rich, smoky flavor and aroma without the use of artificial ingredients, additives, or preservatives. Through the hickory smoking process, the chews are infused with a savory aroma that appeals to both dogs and pet parents alike—ideal for those seeking the benefits of a natural chew without the natural smell. The product is natural with ingredients that are sourced from high-quality livestock. The treat satisfies a dog’s natural desire to chew, helping to reduce destructive behavior. The chew also helps support dental health by scraping away tartar and plaque. Barkworthies ® Hickory Smoked Bully + Collagen Chews are available for dogs of all sizes, with a 6’’ five-pack, a 10-12’’ three-pack, as well as one-packs. “At Barkworthies, product innovation goes hand in hand with our commitment to quality.

Captioned Sarti v. Dow Inc. , No. 25-cv-12744 (E.D.

CASE ALLEGATIONS : Dow, through its subsidiaries, provides various materials science solutions for packaging, infrastructure, mobility, and consumer applications. The Dow class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Dow’s ability to mitigate macroeconomic and tariff-related headwinds, as well as to maintain the financial flexibility needed to support its lucrative dividend, was overstated; and (ii) the true scope and severity of the foregoing headwinds’ negative impacts on Dow’s business and financial condition was understated, particularly with respect to competitive and pricing pressures, softening global sales, and demand for Dow’s products, as well as an oversupply of products in Dow’s global markets.

    "content": "New York City, NY, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Introduction – The Rise of Advanced Laser Technology in Nail Care In 2025, the landscape of personal wellness technology continues to evolve toward precision, convenience, and clinical reliability. Among these advancements, Fungabeam has emerged as a pioneering solution designed to redefine how nail fungus is addressed at home. Combining the precision of medical-grade laser therapy with the accessibility of a portable consumer device, Fungabeam represents a significant leap in non-invasive antifungal technology. Nail fungus — or onychomycosis — is one of the most persistent conditions affecting millions worldwide. Traditional treatments often rely on topical creams or oral medications, which can take months to show visible results or may introduce unwanted side effects. Fungabeam offers a different approach : it uses targeted low-level laser light to penetrate through the nail plate, reaching the infection source directly beneath the surface. This scientific method enables deeper, more efficient fungal management without the need for chemicals or prescriptions. As part of a growing category of smart home wellness devices, Fungabeam embodies precision engineering, user safety, and long-term reliability. Built with advanced light modulation technology and safety sensors, it delivers focused energy where it’s needed most — restoring clarity, strength, and natural appearance to affected nails. The introduction of Fungabeam marks a new era in self-care innovation, giving individuals access to professional-grade laser therapy in the comfort of their homes, with performance standards previously reserved for clinical treatment environments. Visit the Official FungaBeam Website What Is Fungabeam? – The Breakthrough Laser Device for Treating Nail Fungus at Home Fungabeam represents a new generation of at-home laser technology engineered to target one of the most stubborn and recurring conditions affecting millions worldwi"

    "content": "SEATTLE, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WatchGuard® Technologies , a global leader in unified cybersecurity for managed service providers (MSPs), today released the findings of its latest Internet Security Report , a quarterly analysis detailing the top malware, network, and endpoint security threats observed by the WatchGuard Threat Lab researchers during April through June, the second quarter of 2025. The report’s key findings reveal a 40% (quarter-over-quarter) increase in evasive, advanced malware. The data highlights encrypted channels as adversaries favored attack vector using Transport Layer Security (TLS), the encryption protocol behind most secure web traffic. While TLS is vital for protecting users, attackers increasingly exploit it to disguise malicious payloads. Overall malware detections rose 15% in Q2, driven by an 85% increase from Gateway AntiVirus (GAV) and a 10% gain from IntelligentAV (IAV), underscoring IAV’s growing role in catching sophisticated threats. With 70% of all malware now delivered via encrypted connections, the findings highlight attackers’ increasing reliance on obfuscation and stealth, and the need for organizations to improve visibility into encrypted traffic and adopt flexible protection strategies. The Threat Lab also observed a slight rise in network attacks, increasing by 8.3%. At the same time, the diversity of attacks narrowed, with 380 unique signatures triggered compared to 412 last quarter. Notably, a brand-new malicious JavaScript detection, “WEB-CLIENT JavaScript Obfuscation in Exploit Kits,” entered the data, underscoring how quickly new threats can proliferate using obfuscation as an evasion technique to evade legacy controls. The findings show that while novel exploits emerge, attackers continue to rely heavily on older, widely used vulnerabilities in browsers, web frameworks, and open-source tools. “Across Q2, the report’s findings point to a rise in evasive malware over encrypted channels as attackers work har"

    "content": "As pets increasingly take center stage in the family unit, Rover's latest campaign leans into the joy of finding pet sitters and walkers who truly “get your pet” Developed in partnership with Orchard Creative and Park Pictures, “We Get Your Pet” is now running on digital, social, and connected TV platforms SEATTLE, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rover , the world's largest online marketplace for loving pet care, today launched, \"We Get Your Pet,\" a new advertising campaign that tackles a truth every pet parent knows: leaving your pet in someone else’s care can be stress-inducing, because they might not see them the way you do. The campaign arrives at a cultural moment when pets have firmly established themselves as members of the family. Gen Z and millennials now represent half of all pet parents in the United States, with seven in ten Gen Z adults reporting they'd rather have pets than children 1 . As a result, demand for the right pet care has never been higher. \"Pet parents aren't just looking for someone who can feed their pet. They're looking for someone who understands their pet is irreplaceable,\" said Ashton Doyle, Senior Director of Brand Marketing at Rover. \"Rover has always understood what pet parents need most: someone who sees their pet the way they do. This campaign shows that sitters on Rover don't just tolerate what makes your pet unique, they celebrate it.\" Developed in partnership with strategic creative agency Orchard Creative and production company Park Pictures, the campaign features pets being unapologetically themselves – weird, wonderful, and totally unique. The ad spots showcase the magic that happens when a pet has a sitter who truly gets them….or, “matches their freak.” “Using a music track that's very provocative, and then applying that provocativeness to pet behaviors, is strange and funny, but really captures how much pet parents think their dogs and cats are secretly little freaks,” said Heather Larimer, Executive Creative Director"

IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR DOW INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On June 23, 2025, BMO Capital downgraded its recommendation on Dow from “Market Perform” to “Underperform” and cut its price target on the Company’s stock citing sustained weakness across key end markets and mounting pressure on the Company’s dividend. On this news, Dow’s stock price fell $0.89, or 3.2%, to close at $26.87 per share on June 23, 2025, thereby injuring investors. Then, on July 24, 2024, Dow released its second quarter 2025 financial results, reporting a non-GAAP loss per share of $0.42 and net sales of $10.1 billion, missing consensus estimates “reflecting declines in all operating segments.” The Company also revealed that it was cutting its dividend in half, from $0.70 per share to only $0.35 per share, citing the need for “financial flexibility amidst a persistently challenging macroeconomic environment.” On this news, Dow’s stock price fell $5.30, or 17.5%, to close at $25.07 per share on July 24, 2025, thereby injuring investors further.

After five decades of growth in Lee’s Summit, MO, the company has commenced manufacturing operations at its new North American facility located in Munnsville, NY, designed to enhance product innovation, production capacity and customer experience. \"This is a pivotal moment in the 50-year history of the Billy Goat brand,\" said Pierre Pereira, general manager, Billy Goat. \"This move modernizes our manufacturing operations, ensuring the delivery of cutting-edge products, reliable service and new innovations for the professionals and homeowners who depend on our products daily.” The new next-generation manufacturing plant represents a strategic leap forward from Billy Goat’s original Lee’s Summit location and satellite warehouse. Centralizing operations under one roof will increase capacity and efficiency, and accelerate the delivery of products to customers worldwide. This transition represents a significant investment in the future of the brand and its commitment to both its customers and the specialty turf care market. The company will continue to operate a satellite office in Lee’s Summit, preserving its Missouri heritage and ensuring a smooth transition for its team and customers. “As we look ahead, our commitment remains unchanged,” Pereira added. “We’re investing in the future so our customers can continue to count on Billy Goat to \"take the chore out of the chore\" by supporting them with the most innovative and high-quality equipment that makes their work faster and easier. The new Munnsville facility—which will leverage Briggs & Stratton’s existing 117-year manufacturing expertise —is designed to uphold that commitment for decades to come. ### About Briggs & Stratton Briggs & Stratton, headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, provides innovative produ"

    "content": "LOS ANGELES, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming November 20, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc. (“RCI” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RICK ) securities between December 15, 2021 and September 16, 2025 , inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR RCI INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On September 16, 2025, the New York Attorney General announced that top executives of RCI had been indicted “for their roles in a major, multimillion dollar criminal tax fraud and bribery scheme.” Specifically, the Company, along with five of its executives, and three of its Manhattan strip clubs, were facing 79 charges, including conspiracy, bribery, and criminal tax fraud stemming from the alleged bribe of a government tax auditor. On this news, RCI’s stock price fell $5.53, or 15.9%, to close at $28.79 on September 16, 2025, thereby injuring investors. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Defendants engaged in tax fraud; (2) Defendants committed bribery to cover up the fact that they committed tax fraud; (3) as a result, Defendants understated the legal risk facing the Company; and (4) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired RCI securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no la"

Talkdesk has selected Databricks to power the data foundation for its Customer Experience Automation (CXA) platform , accelerating the future of responsible, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven customer engagement through its Built on Databricks Partner Program . Traditional customer service data often sits scattered across contact center as a service (CCaaS), customer relationship management (CRM), and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. This makes it challenging to scale data pipelines or manage compliance for large, unstructured interaction datasets. The Talkdesk and Databricks partnership addresses this by delivering: Unified intelligence: Talkdesk CXA AI Agents get real-time access to the full customer history across all channels through zero-copy integration with customer data. Smarter automation: Rich, contextual data allows Talkdesk AI Agents to provide personalized, accurate, and adaptive responses. Trusted AI foundation: The solution is built on a governed, enterprise-grade infrastructure that helps meet compliance, security, and explainability standards. “Through this partnership, we are giving enterprise customers a safe, scalable way to deploy AI that truly transforms how businesses service their customers. Integrating the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform with Talkdesk’s CXA platform gives companies 360° visibility into customer interactions, fueling more intelligent automation and analytics. This allows them to build responsibly and meet compliance and transparency standards from the start, at an accelerated pace,” said Munil Shah, chief technology officer of Talkdesk. Talkdesk CXA, announced in June 2025, automates and coordinates complex service, sales, and support processes from the front office through the back office.

    "content": "TORONTO, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As the provincial legislature returns, l'Association des enseignantes et des enseignants franco-ontariens (AEFO), Elementary Teachers’ Federation of Ontario (ETFO), Ontario English Catholic Teachers’ Association (OECTA), Ontario School Board Council of Unions (CUPE-OSBCU), and Ontario Secondary School Teachers’ Federation (OSSTF) have issued the following joint statement: The Ford government introduced Bill 33, the Supporting Children and Students Act , earlier this year. It is a regressive piece of legislation that does nothing to support students and everything to consolidate power in the hands of the Minister of Education. Our schools are facing a crisis, but not the one this government is pretending to solve. Ontario’s public education system is buckling under the weight of underfunding. Class sizes are ballooning. Essential programs are being cut. Teachers and education workers are stretched to the breaking point. Student needs are going unmet, resulting in learning gaps and growing school violence. Put simply, there are not nearly enough trained professionals or services to properly support our students. We have seen this playbook before. The centralization of power, the erosion of local democracy, and the imposition of punitive systems are hallmarks of American-style politics. Unfortunately, Premier Ford seems eager to emulate them all. This is not the Ontario we believe in. Minister Paul Calandra’s first legislative act in his new role is not about improving safety or educational outcomes; it is a calculated political maneuver designed to distract from the real crisis in Ontario education: chronic underfunding and reckless understaffing. Instead of investing in smaller class sizes and supports for students in schools, the government is choosing to scapegoat trustees while trying to hide that, since 2018, they have cut $6.3 billion out of our publicly funded education system. In early September, Minister Calandra s"

    "content": "PALO ALTO, Calif. and ORLANDO, Fla., Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Talkdesk®, Inc. today announced a significant enhancement to Talkdesk Copilot , introducing new agentic artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities that allow customer service agents to request real-time assistance in highly complex situations. Unlike traditional AI assistants that provide limited, scripted guidance or limited article responses, the newly enhanced Copilot can understand multi-layered questions, synthesize information across systems, and deliver context-aware recommendations and actions — helping agents resolve issues that previously required escalation to a subject matter expert or manual research. Built on the Talkdesk Customer Experience Automation (CXA) platform , Copilot now uses agentic reasoning to interpret the context of the conversation to analyze multiple knowledge sources and generate accurate, actionable answers, all within seconds. Agents remain in complete control, invoking Copilot when they need deeper insight or faster resolution, while ensuring every AI interaction is transparent, traceable, and governed by enterprise-grade security standards. For example, a healthcare provider representative can ask, “This patient needs their first diabetic eye exam and wants to know what to expect and what to bring. Walk me through the preparation and scheduling process.\" Copilot reads the context of the current conversations, generates a tailored answer based on analysis of the patient and the health system's knowledge base and existing integrated services, guides the agent through the scheduling steps while handling the patient's questions and concerns, and texts the patient the necessary information. “With Talkdesk CXA, we’re creating a new era of intelligent automation in which AI and people work together seamlessly to elevate every customer interaction,” said Tiago Paiva, chief executive officer and founder of Talkdesk. “The new Copilot capabilities show how automation can"

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than December 8, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured "

The campaign is calling on all provinces and territories to take immediate action to implement a mandatory standard of care that includes support for essential daily diabetes management tasks and emergency prevention and treatment. \"Diabetes is relentless. Many children living with diabetes in Canada are being put at risk and stigmatized because most provinces and territories do not have a policy to guide school boards on creating a supportive school environment for students managing diabetes,\" said Laura Syron, President and CEO of Diabetes Canada. \"Every student deserves the support they need to be safe, healthy and included at school, no matter what their postal code is.\" Dangerous and inequitable patchwork system Currently, only Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and British Columbia have mandated standards of care that closely align with Diabetes Canada's guidelines . Diabetes Canada is urgently calling on all other provincial/territorial governments to implement a mandatory standard of care for all school boards to adopt and implement. In the absence of clear policies, students are experiencing preventable health emergencies (setting the stage for long-term health complications), being excluded from class activities, and missing learning opportunities. Families are being asked to fill the gaps—leaving work, stepping in as caregivers during the school day, or even removing their children from school entirely. \"The lack of consistent policies in these jurisdictions has resulted in a dangerous patchwork system where a child's access to the support they need depends on where they attend school,\" Syron emphasized. \"The solution is clear—all provinces and territories must mandate a s"

    "content": "OMAHA, Neb., Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WestCX , part of the West Technology Group , today announced the launch of its agentic AI solution engineered to optimize pharmacy-patient interactions. The solution enables pharmacies to automate patient communications, improve medication adherence, and reduce operational strain. Available through WestCX’s Mosaicx and TeleVox brands, it blends conversational AI with agentic capabilities to deliver personalized patient interactions across channels via the company’s secure platform. The solution reduces the burden of answering repetitive inbound calls through conversational AI, enabling staff to focus on critical patient care. Its agentic AI capabilities tailor outreach based on patient behavior and context, ensuring every interaction is personalized to increase loyalty and trust. These enhancements empower pharmacies to proactively manage prescription refills, pickup reminders, and vaccine outreach while delivering faster, more connected experiences for patients. Early adopters are already seeing transformative impacts including: Up to 80% automation of standard inquiries (refills, status, FAQs), freeing up resources for core operations 20–35% increase in refill rates through timely, personalized outreach Higher medication adherence and completed vaccine series Thousands of staff hours saved annually through automated inbound and outbound communication, reducing burnout “Pharmacies sit at the front line of patient care, yet their teams are often stretched thin managing administrative and repetitive tasks,” said Sam Meckey, president of WestCX. “With this solution, those fragmented interactions become seamless and directly support critical operational metrics like improved medication adherence and reduced return-to-stock events. Patients get the right message and care at the right time, and pharmacies see stronger loyalty, higher foot traffic, and proven revenue growth.” The new solution equips patients with intuitive "

Der Bericht spiegelt den Einsatz von Rackspace wider, die Ziele der Vereinten Nationen für nachhaltige Entwicklung (SDGs) zu verwirklichen und die Cloud-Dienstleistungsbranche im Hinblick auf Nachhaltigkeit anzuführen. Im Jahr 2025 validierte die Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) unsere Ziele zur Reduzierung von Treibhausgasen (THG) und bestätigte damit unsere messbaren Umweltfortschritte im Einklang mit SDG 13. „Bei Rackspace Technology machen wir Nachhaltigkeit zu einem messbaren Bestandteil unserer Unternehmensführung“, so Gajen Kandiah, Chief Executive Officer von Rackspace Technology. „2025 wurden unsere kurzfristigen und langfristigen Ziele von der SBTi validiert, wir haben die Gesamtemissionen gegenüber unserem Basisjahr 2023 um 10 Prozent reduziert und die Effizienz an vorrangigen Standorten verbessert. Die gleiche Disziplin kommt nun auch darin zum Ausdruck, wie wir unseren Kunden helfen, Kosten und CO₂-Emissionen zu senken. Wir werden weiterhin mit klaren Daten, unabhängigen Überprüfungen und einer starken Unternehmensführung berichten.“ Die Nachhaltigkeitsbemühungen von Rackspace konzentrieren sich auf erneuerbare Energien, Umweltschutz und Interessenvertretung. Etwa 28,4 Prozent des Stroms, der 2024 in den von Rackspace betriebenen Rechenzentren verbraucht wurde, wurde auf Marktbasis durch Stromabnahmeverträge (PPAs) und/oder Zertifikate für erneuerbare Energien (RECs) ausgeglichen.

The night of glamour, gratitude, and inspiration lit up the Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel as GLOBAL hosted its 18th annual Be Beautiful Be Yourself Fashion Show on Saturday, October 18, 2025 . The unforgettable evening attracted over 1,400 guests from across the U.S. and around the world, raising $2.6 million. Recognized as the largest and most celebrated Down syndrome fundraiser in the world, GLOBAL’s Be Beautiful Be Yourself Fashion Show has raised more than $33 million cumulatively since its inception, transforming research and tangible health outcomes for thousands of children and adults with Down syndrome. While celebrities provided star power to the event, it was the 21 models who happen to have Down syndrome who truly stole the spotlight, especially GLOBAL’s 2025 Ambassador, Guion Macsovits . A charismatic freshman at Regis University, Guion walked the runway alongside his friend, two-time Academy Award nominee Jeremy Renner, who introduced Guion as “the real superhero.” Guion received a standing ovation from the audience, including 21 proud family members who traveled from Memphis to celebrate his achievements.

    "content": "Media Kit: Full Report, Methodology, Graphs, B-roll and Soundbites ORANGE, Calif., Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Chapman University today released the results of its 11th annual Chapman University Survey of American Fears , a nationally representative look at what Americans fear most, and how those fears shape public life, decision-making, and emotional well-being. The 2025 survey finds that “corrupt government officials” has remained America’s top fear for the past 10 years, with 69% of respondents reporting they are afraid or very afraid of corruption in government. Other leading fears include a loved one becoming seriously ill (58.9%), economic or financial collapse (58.2%), and cyber-terrorism (55.9%). While these findings reflect real and persistent concerns, the survey’s lead researcher, Dr. Christopher Bader, Chair and Professor of Sociology at Chapman University, emphasizes that fear itself is a complex and revealing measure of how Americans see the world. “ Understanding what we’re afraid of isn’t about stoking anxiety — it’s about putting those fears into context,” said Dr. Bader. “Often, the events that capture the most media and social media attention are rare and unusual. But because they’re highlighted so vividly and so often, they can feel like daily threats. Recognizing that difference helps us regain perspective — and power — over our own emotions.” Putting Fear in Perspective The survey team notes that many fears have less to do with reality and more to do with perception, particularly as traditional and social media amplify dramatic, infrequent events. Although crime rates have steadily declined over the past several years, the survey shows that fear of crime continues to rise. Similarly, fears about global conflict and economic collapse fluctuate sharply from year to year, often tracking the tone of national discourse more than real-world data. “People have greater access to information than ever before, but they’re also more exposed to com"

SO WHAT: If you purchased LifeMD securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the LifeMD class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=43404 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than October 27, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2"

Moderated by renowned television journalist Greta Van Susteren , the panel aims to elevate the conversation around SCD and explore emerging patient-centric therapeutic strategies that promise to improve both daily management and long-term outcomes for this underserved community. Innovation and Recognition Quercis Pharma’s participation in the Summit reflects its deep commitment to underserved patient communities. The company has been nominated for the 2025 Prix Galien USA “Best Startup” Award , one of the most prestigious honors in life sciences, recognizing breakthrough contributions to global health. The nomination highlights Kinisoquin™ , Quercis’ lead drug candidate currently in Phase III clinical trials for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in cancer patients . Unlike traditional blood thinners, which carry significant bleeding risks, Kinisoquin™ is an anti-thrombotic designed to reduce the risk of thrombosis with less bleeding risk than traditional anti-coagulants. “This nomination affirms our mission to develop accessible, inflammasome-modulating and anti-thrombotic therapies that can improve outcomes for patients facing life-threatening conditions, such as cancer, thrombosis, and sickle cell disease,” said Daniel Drexler MD , President and CEO of Quercis USA.

    "content": "TORONTO, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Ontario Federation of Labour (OFL) is calling on the Ford government to formalize funding for union-led training centres, which are essential to building Ontario’s skilled workforce and driving the province’s economic growth. “Union-led training centres are where Ontario’s next generation of workers learn the skills that keep our economy moving,” said Laura Walton, OFL president. “For too long, these centres have operated without the stable, formalized funding they deserve.” Despite being one of the wealthiest provinces in Canada, Ontario continues to fall short on fair and consistent funding across all pathways to work – universities, colleges, and skilled-trades alike. Every worker deserves access to high-quality training, no matter their chosen path. Union-led training centres have a long, proven record of producing highly skilled workers who strengthen the economy and uphold the highest health and safety standards. These centres need stable, transparent funding that is not based on transactional politics and a politically driven approach. Without formalized funding, Ontario risks losing the skilled workforce needed to keep industries strong and competitive. The OFL is calling for a transparent and continuous funding stream for these centres, one that recognizes their value to both workers and the province. “Investing in union-led training is investing in Ontario’s future,” said Walton. “These programs are built by workers, for workers. They deliver real skills, real jobs, and real economic returns.” The OFL is calling on Doug Ford to take immediate action to formalize funding for union-led training centres. Ontario’s workers deserve access to training rooted in safety, equity, and expertise so they can build their futures right here at home.

    "content": "Contains nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive substance. For adult nicotine users only. UPPSALA, Sweden, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nicotine pouch use is soaring in the US, with online discussion up 745% in two years, as Swedish company Emplicure announces it is intending to apply for regulatory approval and launch Seratek®, a patented technology designed to deliver nicotine more quickly at lower strength, in the USA. Cigarettes remain an unresolved public health problem. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates more than 480,000 Americans die from smoking-related illnesses every year — about one in five US deaths. Despite tighter regulation and the growth of e-cigarettes and heated tobacco, smokeless alternatives have yet to make a decisive dent in smoking prevalence. But nicotine pouches are emerging as the fastest-growing product in the category, with demand in the US fuelling shortages of leading brands and sparking lively debate online about price, flavours and availability. Independent studies suggest Seratek® could raise the bar. A pharmacokinetic study published in 2025 found Seratek® released 80% of nicotine within the first five minutes under controlled conditions, even at lower strengths. In a consumer taste test in Sweden (2025) with 123 adult pouch users, Seratek® was preferred over international market leaders on flavour, comfort and discreteness. The company behind the nicotine pouch technology has now confirmed it is preparing to file a Premarket Tobacco (PMT) application for Seratek®, to satisfy the regulatory authorisation required to sell nicotine pouches in the USA. Nicotine pouches were first introduced in Sweden in 2014, building on the country’s long tradition of oral nicotine use. Sweden has now reached smokefree status with adult smoking prevalence under five per cent, one of the few countries in the world to achieve this. No health claims are made for Seratek®. The global nicotine pouch market was worth around U"

Eine neue globale Umfrage von Pebl ergab, dass 86 % der Personal- und Finanzverantwortlichen innerhalb von zwei Jahren ihre internationale Personalbeschaffung ausweiten wollen, wobei fast die Hälfte (48 %) erwartet, dass bis 2027 internationale Mitarbeitende 50 % oder mehr der Belegschaft stellen. Und das aus gutem Grund: 87 % der Führungskräfte sind sich einig, dass die Einstellung von Mitarbeitenden im Ausland wirtschaftlich sinnvoll ist. „Die Ära der vorrangigen Einstellung von Mitarbeitenden im Inland ist vorbei“, so Francoise Brougher, CEO von Pebl. „Unternehmen, die keine grenzüberschreitenden Teams aufbauen, werden den Anschluss verlieren. So einfach ist das. Lohninflation, Fachkräftemangel im KI-Bereich und komplexe Vorschriften – von steigenden Kosten für H-1B-Visa bis hin zu Compliance-Hürden – erschweren es Unternehmen, ihre Wachstumsziele zu erreichen. Kluge Unternehmen suchen weltweit nach Talenten, und wir können dabei helfen.“ Von den USA bis Europa – Personalbeschaffung ist heute standardmäßig global ausgerichtet Die globale Personalbeschaffung erfolgt nicht mehr schrittweise, sondern nimmt rasant Fahrt auf. Führungskräfte prognostizieren für das nächste Jahr einen Anstieg der internationalen Einstellungen um 57 %, der innerhalb von 24 Monaten auf 69 % steigen soll. Fast die Hälfte gibt an, die globale Personalbeschaffung bis Anfang 2026 zu verstärken, wobei die USA am aggressivsten vorgehen (46 %), gefolgt von Deutschland (43 %) und Großbritannien (38 %). Großbritannien hingegen verdoppelt seine Bemühungen. Die Führungskräfte dort erwarten eine mehr als doppelte Steigerung der globalen Personalbeschaffung, von 38 % in sechs Monaten auf 85 % in 24 Monaten. Bis 2028 gehen 40 % aller Führungskräfte davon aus, "

This extraordinary growth is driven by the success of Willo’s newest models — the Wedge SurfaceMax™ and Wedge Slim™ — which together account for approximately 75% of all new Wedge sales. Both products incorporate existing and new patent-pending tamper-resistant and security innovations that directly address the most urgent needs of today’s correctional facilities. Nearly 30% of total Wedge sales are attributed to the Wedge Slim™, designed specifically for new construction. This surge underscores a significant industry shift: facility owners and design teams are intentionally improving door and lock security during the construction phase rather than waiting for systems to fail or be compromised. “Our customers’ response has been remarkable,” said Russell Roberts, President at Willo Products. “Facilities are investing in reliability, safety, and proven innovation from Willo. The rapid adoption of our latest Wedge technologies validates that Willo is solving the real-world security issues our industry faces right now.” The Wedge SurfaceMax™ was engineered for retrofit applications, bringing next-generation protection to existing facilities, while the Wedge Slim™ delivers the same high level of tamper resistance to new correctional center projects. Together, these products allow facilities to strengthen security proactively, whether upgrading aging infrastructure or designing modern, resilient detention environments from the ground up. “This level of growth demonstrates more than market success. It represents broad industry confidence in Willo’s innovations to improve security that everyone deserves,” added Roberts. “Correctional leaders ac"

Growth in all Divisions . Momentum accelerating across the board between the first six and nine months. Growth in all regions, boosted by the continuing recovery in North America and mainland China . Continued strong momentum in haircare and fragrances ; makeup sequentially improving. Growth in both volume and value with a strong contribution from mix. Double-digit growth online , well ahead of the market. Announcement of a long-termstrategic partnership in luxury beauty and wellness between Kering and L’Oréal. TIME included three of L’Oréal’s innovations – Air Light Pro , Lancôme Rénergie Nano-Resurfacer and Melasyl – in its ranking of The Best Inventions of 2025 . Commenting these figures, Nicolas Hieronimus, CEO of L'Oréal, said: “As anticipated, our like-for-like growth continued to sequentially accelerate, reaching +4.9% in the third quarter 1 . Progress was broad-based. All regions contributed: the recovery in our two largest markets – the US and mainland China – continued; in a solid market, Europe remained robust; and ongoing strength in SAPMENA-SSA more than offset the softness in Latin America. Growth accelerated across all Divisions, as the weight of new launches further increased in the third quarter fuelled by our Beauty Stimulus Plan . The global beauty market remains dynamic with a progressive improvement in luxury. Our strength online allows us to outperform what is today the most dynamic channel. We just announced a strategic alliance with Kering, one of the world’s most creative and visionary luxury groups. I am delighted by this partnership: the acquisition of Creed will make us one of the leading players in niche fragrances; and I see enormous potential for growth for the beauty and fragrance licenses of Gucci, Bottega Veneta and Balenciaga, all truly exceptional couture brands.

The 130,000 square foot facility will produce up to 500 metric tons of Electra’s low-carbon, high-purity iron annually. The facility, expected to begin operations in mid-2026, will deploy Electra’s technology to convert iron ore into 99% pure iron using its proprietary low-temperature process powered by chemistry and clean energy. The facility is supported by a new $50 million grant from Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, a program within Breakthrough Energy that funds and helps scale early commercial clean energy projects, and an $8 million dollar tax credit from the Colorado Industrial Tax Credit Offering (CITCO) along with $186 million in Series B funding announced earlier this year. “Steel production is one of the largest sources of emissions, driven primarily by the energy-intensive step of refining iron. Electra is reimagining the fundamentals of ironmaking, enabling a scalable, cost-effective pathway to low-carbon steel,” said Mario Fernandez, Head of Catalyst at Breakthrough Energy. “Working in close collaboration with BE Catalyst, Electra applied the 12 Keys to Scaling Up to systematically de-risk their technology, assemble a world-class team, and lay the foundation for commercialization.” Purchase Agreements with Global Steel Leaders Clean iron produced at Electra’s demonstration facility is already contracted for delivery to several strategic partners to qualify the material for use in steel applications. Signed purchase orders include Nucor, the largest steelmaker in the United States and early investor of Electra, Toyota Tsusho, the global steel trading company, and INTERFER Edelstahl Group, the European steel and metals distributor. Nucor will use Electra’s clean iron in their Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) steelmaking, a lower-emission alternative to traditional blast furnace methods, at th"

The 13.3-inch device delivers a print-like look, with the connectivity of a modern smart photo frame—demonstrating how E Ink’s color platforms enable new consumer experiences that are battery-efficient, ambient, and comfortable to view in any light. The Aura Ink launch highlights several firsts for the connected photo category: a 0.6-inch ultra-slim profile, up to three months of battery life per charge, and a subtle front light that preserves the technology’s paper-like qualities while adapting to ambient conditions and shutting off at night. Battery life may vary based on factors such as the amount of time per day the front light is illuminated, image update frequency, WiFi strength, and more. Aura also employs their own proprietary dithering algorithm to expand Spectra 6’s color palette into millions of perceived tones, producing a vintage, photo-real effect that resonates with how people display images at home. “Aura’s launch of a wireless, wall-friendly color ePaper frame is a milestone for the category and for E Ink,” said JM Hung, Vice President of E Ink. “Spectra 6 is unlocking a new generation of consumer products that look and feel like printed media, remaining readable, reflective, and incredibly power-efficient while staying connected and dynamic. We’re thrilled to partner with Aura as they bring this experience to their audience of photo lovers.” The launch of Aura Ink expands E Ink’s reach into the connected home, demonstrating how color ePaper can enhance everyday décor and ambient surfaces while complementing E Ink’s established presence in eReaders, eNotes, retail signage, and wearables.

    "content": "SAN JOSE, Calif., Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DTEX , the trusted leader in insider risk management, today announced it has been awarded U.S. Patent No. 12,423,428 for its “Method and System for Inferring Document Sensitivity.” The patent underpins DTEX’s recently released Risk-Adaptive Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solution, enabling enterprises to automatically identify and protect sensitive data across human and AI-driven workflows. “AI has rewritten the rules of data protection. This patent shows DLP must follow,” said Marshall Heilman, CEO of DTEX. “Data no longer sits in controlled repositories. It flows across cloud apps, AI assistants, and copy-paste workflows. Protecting it requires DLP that evolves with AI, delivering visibility, adaptive intelligence, and control.” The announcement comes as organizations face escalating exposure risks fueled by the widespread use of generative AI. Research shows that tools such as ChatGPT, Copilot, and Claude have become some of the largest uncontrolled channels for data leakage, often surpassing shadow SaaS and unmanaged file sharing. According to EY’s 2025 Responsible AI Pulse survey , 99% of companies deploying AI reported financial losses tied to AI-related risks, with nearly two-thirds losing more than $1 million and an average loss of $4.4 million. That reality was underscored at DTEX NEXT , where industry leaders weighed in. Kevin Mandia, Founder, Mandiant; Rear Admiral (Ret.) Mike Studeman, former Commander, Office of Naval Intelligence; and David Hahn, Operating Partner at Ballistic Ventures, all stressed the same point. Traditional DLP — built for sanctioned, file-based environments — no longer meets the needs of today’s AI-driven enterprises. Their message was clear: risk-adaptive protection is now an industry imperative. DTEX’s patented technology takes that approach. Instead of relying on static rules or deep content inspection, it uses behavioral analytics and machine learning to dynamically infer docume"

    "content": "SEATTLE, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Emovid today announced it has been granted a U.S. patent for its proprietary process and visual verification seal that authenticate the identity, voice, tone, and expression of a message sender. The patented technology ensures that any message sent through Emovid can be trusted—whether it remains fully original or includes limited, transparent modifications such as lighting adjustments, background changes, or cosmetic visual filters. In an era where AI-generated content has blurred the line between what is real and what is fabricated, Emovid’s verification process restores confidence in communication. Every message sent through the platform confirms the sender’s identity and preserves the integrity of their words, tone, and expressions. If any element has been modified, the platform clearly displays this information through a visual seal, allowing recipients to see exactly what has changed. Sending a message through Emovid requires no special software or downloads. Users just need to record a short base video message directly on the platform, which is then converted into multi-format outputs—video, audio, text, and translated versions—so recipients can view, listen to, or read the message at their convenience. Each message generates a secure URL that can be shared across all major communication channels, including email, Slack, Teams, LinkedIn, chat systems, newsletters, and websites. The verification process works in both directions, ensuring that every message sent or received—whether one-on-one, in a group, or as a BCC—is authentic and transparently verified. “We’ve entered a world where it’s increasingly difficult to distinguish real communication from AI-generated or altered content,” said Victor Cho , co-founder and CEO of Emovid. “This patent represents a critical step toward rebuilding trust in digital communication by providing a simple, transparent way to validate what’s real.” Rupali Pathania , co-founder of Em"

A strategic enabler to Aligning Audit and Warfighter Success, the Quick Start program delivers comprehensive digitization, AI-powered analytics and Audit Ready Applications for the Federal Government’s financial value chains. Specifically designed to support the Department of Defense (DoD) Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) mandate, the Quick Start program outcomes enhance financial process cycles, strengthen system controls and improve records and insights. By integrating financial transactions and documentation throughout the entire financial lifecycle, agencies can efficiently achieve audit readiness. ClearInfo Quick Start Audit Ready Applications Program The 2024 DoD Financial OIG Report identified 28 Material Weaknesses that deter the DoD from achieving a clean financial audit opinion. Lack of Supporting Documentation was determined to be a reason for each of the 28 Material Weaknesses. The DoD’s inability to design its control environment and business processes or have policies and procedures to maintain supporting documentation contributes to these weaknesses. To eliminate this significant challenge for the DoD, ClearInfo has created a Quick Start Audit Ready Applications Program. The 90-120-day Quick Start Program will also allow DoD agencies to prototype ClearInfo’s Audit Ready Applications Platform C-CCARS. At the completion of the Quick Start Program each agency will have: Designed and implemented one business process that maintains supporting documentation throughout the entire lifecycle. Been trained in the methods of deploying and administering the Audit Ready Applications program. An Audit Ready Applications Enterprise Blueprint "

The agreement reflects WASL’s long-term confidence in the Northeast England region and the expansion will increase maintenance, repair and overhaul (“MRO”) services capacity. “With this acquisition, we take another strategic step toward offering end-to-end aviation services and supporting the continued growth of the United Kingdom’s aviation industry,” said Charles F. Willis, WLFC’s Executive Chairman. Phil Forster, Managing Director of Teesside Airport, said: \"WLFC has been a fantastic supporter of Teesside Airport for many years, and this long-lease agreement is a huge step in their commitment to our airport and our region. “Their investment in a new twin-bay hangar launched this week, and the new maintenance contracts they’ve secured in the past year, show just how serious their team is when it comes to growing here and creating more well-paid, skilled jobs in Teesside. “Teesside is fast becoming the go-to place for aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul, and we’re taking big strides forward in becoming an ideal one-stop shop for major operators. This is a hugely significant moment for Teesside Airport and a major milestone in securing the airport’s long-term future.\" Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said: \"When we saved our airport from closure, we did it because it was the right thing to do. We also believed it had the huge potential to bring so many more jobs for local people and more investment. “Securing more holiday flights will always be vital, and I’ll never lose sight"

    "content": "NEW YORK, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, announces an investigation of potential securities claims on behalf of shareholders of agilon health, inc. (NYSE: AGL) resulting from allegations that agilon health may have issued materially misleading business information to the investing public. SO WHAT: If you purchased agilon health securities you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. The Rosen Law Firm is preparing a class action seeking recovery of investor losses. What to do next: To join the prospective class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=46039 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. WHAT IS THIS ABOUT: On August 4, 2025, agilon health issued a press release entitled “agilon health Reports Second Quarter 2025 Results.” Commenting on the results, agilon health’s Executive Chair stated that “as we progressed through this transition year, it’s become clear that the industry headwinds are more acute than previously expected[.]” Further, the release announced that the company was “suspending its previously issued full-year 2025 financial guidance and related assumptions.” On this news, agilon health’s stock fell 51.5% on August 5, 2025. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time."

Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017.

Click here to participate in the action. NEW YORK, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- What’s Happening: Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C ., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, is investigating potential claims against F5, Inc. (“F5” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:FFIV) on behalf of F5 stockholders. Our investigation concerns whether F5 has violated the federal securities laws and/or engaged in other unlawful business practices. Investigation Details: On October 15, 2025, F5 revealed that it had learned in early August that a “highly sophisticated nation-state threat actor had gained unauthorized access to certain F5 systems.” The Company added, “during the course of its investigation, F5 determined that the threat actor maintained long-term, persistent access to certain F5 systems, including the BIG-IP product development environment and engineering knowledge management platform,” and that “through this access, certain files were exfiltrated, some of which contained certain portions of the Company’s BIG-IP source code and information about undisclosed vulnerabilities that it was working on in BIG-IP.” On this news, the price of F5 shares declined by $35.40 per share, or approximately 10.70%, from $330.75 per share on October 15, 2025 to close at $295.35 on October 16, 2025. Next Steps: If you purchased or otherwise acquired F5 shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at inves"

One Choice was founded in 2022 in Davie, FL and quickly grew to over $6M in 2024. As they grew, their commitment to paying their drivers weekly and buying materials monthly started putting them in a cash crunch. “We pride ourselves in paying our drivers and subs on time, every time,” said Azohani “Nani” Bernal , CEO, One Choice Logistics. “But the bigger contracts we won, the longer our accounts receivables stretched—anywhere from 60 to 90 days at times, putting stress on our finances.” One Choice turned to TruckIT , the market-leading technology provider for digitizing and optimizing the bulk hauling supply chain, and its partner Bolton Capital , a specialized financial services firm focused on the needs of dump truck haulers. Together, the two companies are committed to solving one of the industry’s most persistent challenges—cash flow—and empowering haulers to get paid faster, take on more work and grow their businesses. “We were carrying more than $600K in invoices this summer,” continued Bernal. “Bolton funded 400K to us in 48 hours, and the remaining $200K the following Monday. We’ve had them fund our invoices every week, ever since.” By integrating Bolton Capital’s rapid payment capabilities with TruckIT’s advanced digital e-Ticketing platform, One Choice now enjoys a seamless transition from job completion to cash in the bank. One Choice simply submits its invoices via the TruckIT platform, and Bolton’s ticket-matching technology ensures instant verification and payment. “We were in a tough spot trying to keep up with the big names in our space,” said Bernal. “Bolton and TruckIT helped us change that. They are part of our team now, helping keep our drivers, subcontractors, and customers paid and happy.”"

    "content": "Dublin, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Strategic Intelligence: Deep Dive into Age Assurance Tools\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. Age assurance is an umbrella term encompassing various mechanisms used to verify a person's age or age range. Typically, it involves confirming age or age range to a sufficient standard to comply with laws and regulations that specify a particular minimum age, which must be checked exactly. Social media, video streaming, and gaming platforms already use various age-assurance methods, although few of them use age assurance at the registration process. Facebook, Reddit, TikTok, and Roblox use age verification before granting users access to age-restricted content. Key Highlights Age assurance methods are far from foolproof. Aside from falsely self-declaring their age, minors may employ other strategies to circumvent systems, such as using virtual private networks (VPNs). However, concerns about VPNs' ability to bypass legislation are often exaggerated, and VPN use is not necessarily proof that age estimation tools are ineffective. There is still work to be done to improve age assurance technology. Errors in age estimation technology are inevitable, and alternative methods are required to correct them. Age assurance must be combined with content moderation and algorithm checks to mitigate online harm, and a safety-by-design approach must be prioritized. Report Scope This report looks at all aspects of age assurance, with particular reference to its impact on online safety It includes geographical analysis of age assurance implementation, including coverage of the UK, US, EU, Australia, China, and India. It evaluates the challenges inherent in age assurance tools, and looks at how companies can mitigate their online safety risk. Reasons to Buy Age assurance is a key tool for enforcing online safety legislation. Platforms can only protect children from harmful content if they know their age. The UK and th"

Notably, with 214,000 tourists over the 8-day period - a 26% increase over 2024 - Eid Al Fitr 2025 brought in the most holiday arrivals in three years. Major events such as the FIFA World Cup 2022 have further boosted the market by attracting large numbers of visitors requiring food and beverage services. Also, the expanding corporate sector, with a rise in conferences, exhibitions, and business gatherings, has created consistent demand for professional catering. Changing consumer lifestyles and growing preference for outsourced catering solutions among businesses and individuals also contribute to market growth. Also, advancements in food technology and service quality improvements are encouraging market expansion, making Qatar's catering services sector highly competitive and dynamic.

North America's pet funeral services market is continuously growing, driven growth in pet ownership and spending on pet care, expansion of service offerings and technological adoption and increasing awareness and professionalization of pet aftercare services. North America has one of the world's highest pet ownership rates, with households owning multiple pets, especially dogs and cats.

The global pharmaceutical contract development and manufacturing organization market size was estimated at USD 166.0 Billion in 2025 and is projected to reach USD 293.6 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 7.38% from 2025 to 2033. Growth in the market can be attributed to the rising investments by CDMOs to expand new drug development and the increasing demand for novel therapies. In addition, growing investments in pharmaceutical R&D, rising demand for genetic drugs, and growing prevalence of cancer & age-related disorders, coupled with increasing need for advanced therapeutics, are some of the key factors driving market growth. The pharmaceutical industry is experiencing a significant shift from traditional small molecules to biopharmaceuticals. This includes monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, recombinant proteins, and other therapies such as mRNA treatments. In addition, this shift is driven by the growing prevalence of chronic diseases, an aging global population, and the increasing access to targeted therapies that tend to provide better efficacy and fewer side effects than conventional treatments. According to the data published by IQVIA in January 2024, the global medicine spending at list prices is anticipated to rise by 38% between 2024 and 2028, with biologics accounting for more than 40% of that growth, reflecting the central role in the treatments. Regulators such as the U.S. FDA continue to clear record numbers of innovative biologics, approving 50 novel drugs in 2024, of which a significant proportion were advanced biologics and specialty medicines, supported by a 74% first-cycle approv"

The global veterinary hospital market size was estimated at USD 66.17 Billion in 2025 and is projected to reach USD 120.13 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 7.74% from 2025 to 2033. Some of the factors driving the market growth are the consolidation of animal hospitals, the growing animal population & adoption, the rising awareness of animal health, & increasing adoption of pet insurance. The consolidation of veterinary hospitals is reshaping the competitive landscape of the animal healthcare sector, creating a structural shift from fragmented, independently run clinics to streamlined, multi-unit networks owned by corporate groups and private equity firms. This trend is driven by the growing complexity of veterinary services, which now increasingly require capital-intensive infrastructure such as diagnostic labs, surgical suites, digital imaging, and cloud-based practice management systems, investments that are difficult for single-site operators to make independently. As pet ownership surges and clients demand more sophisticated, 24/7 services, large consolidators are stepping in to bridge this gap, acquiring independent hospitals and folding them into branded platforms with centralized procurement, HR, marketing, and administrative support. For veterinarians nearing retirement, these buyouts offer a clean exit and financial upside, while younger practitioners benefit from reduced managerial burden and improved access to technology. Meanwhile, corporate groups are utilizing these roll-ups to introduce tiered care models, subscription-based wellness plans, and scalable telehealth services across entire regions. This allows them to capture more lifetime value "

    "content": "ABBOTSFORD, British Columbia, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Now into the fifth month of their strike for equal pay, Rogers technicians in Abbotsford are hoping fairness and decency will prevail when negotiations with the company resume on Monday, Oct. 27. “It’s unconscionable that a small group of workers has been forced to sacrifice and fight this massively wealthy corporation for so long, for the basic principle of equal pay for equal work,” said Michael Phillips, President of United Steelworkers union (USW) Local 1944, which represents the technicians. “There’s no justification, financially or otherwise, for treating these workers as second-class employees. It’s time for Rogers to do the right thing and agree to a fair and reasonable contract on Monday,” Phillips added. On the picket line since June 19, the 25 technicians passed the fourth month of their strike last Sunday. The major issue in the labour dispute has been the refusal by Rogers to pay the Abbotsford workers the same compensation that it pays to its technicians elsewhere in B.C.’s Lower Mainland, including Vancouver, Surrey, Langley and Mission. “Rather than negotiate a fair settlement, Rogers has prolonged the dispute by spending significant amounts of money to bring managers from across the country to Abbotsford to perform the work of its striking employees,” Phillips said. “They’re continuing to exploit a loophole in the new federal anti-scab legislation which was intended to prevent the use of replacement workers. It’s a shameful practice that violates the spirit of the law,” he said. The federal NDP has pledged to introduce an amendment to close the loophole in the law. Meanwhile, the union has a new fixture on its picket lines – a giant inflatable rat which is a symbol of scab workers, drawing further attention to Rogers’ use of replacement workers. The union and company last met at the bargaining table on Oct. 1, with Rogers once again opposing the concept of equal pay for equal work. “A"

    "content": "CLEARWATER, Fla., Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FrankCrum, a leading professional employer organization (PEO), announced today the expansion of its California sales presence alongside the admission of its affiliated insurance carrier, Frank Winston Crum Insurance (FWCI), to provide workers’ compensation coverage for PEO clients in the state. Together, these developments strengthen FrankCrum’s ability to serve California employers in one of the most highly regulated employment environments in the nation. FrankCrum’s expanded California footprint now includes sales teams in San Luis Obispo (Central Coast), San Diego, East Los Angeles, and West Los Angeles. While the company has long supported clients across the state, these local teams will deepen its ability to connect directly with business owners and deliver tailored HR, payroll, benefits, and risk management solutions. “California’s employment laws are among the most complex in the country, and that often leaves business owners carrying the burden of compliance instead of focusing on growth,” said Matt Crum, Co-President of FrankCrum and President of FWCI. “By expanding our carrier operations into California, we’re able to deliver more personalized solutions and partner closely with our clients to manage claims, support employees’ return to work, and drive better outcomes for both businesses and their people.” Leading the California sales team will be Regional Sales Manager Mateo Zapata, who also oversees FrankCrum’s Arizona market. His role will ensure California businesses have direct access to FrankCrum’s expertise and hands-on support. \"California has long been a place where innovation and entrepreneurship come together to create positive economic growth,” said Michael Henry, Senior Vice President of Direct Sales at FrankCrum. “Thirty percent of the US tech economy is tied to the Golden State. Eleven percent of the country's manufacturing and over 10,000 construction companies are there. Many of these bu"

Join the practical 1 day virtual course conducted by senior market expert on 17 of Oct to learn about they key components of AIFMD 2 and how to best prepare for the upcoming changes. The Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) has been a cornerstone of EU financial regulation since its implementation in 2013, establishing a harmonised framework for the management and marketing of alternative investment funds (AIFs). With the advent of AIFMD 2, coming in April 2026, the EU has introduced significant amendments to address gaps, enhance investor protection, and align the regime with evolving market practices. This workshop provides a comprehensive deep dive into AIFMD 2, equipping asset managers, private bankers, and hedge fund professionals with the knowledge to navigate the revised regulatory landscape. Key updates build upon a decade of AIFMD implementation, including stricter rules on delegation, enhanced liquidity risk management, and more granular reporting requirements. Firms must now reassess their operational models, particularly in areas like loan origination, depositaries, and cross-border marketing, to ensure compliance. The session will also explore the directive's interplay with other regulations, such as the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) and MiFID II, ensuring a holistic understanding of the compliance burden. Whether you are a compliance officer, portfolio manager, or risk specialist, this workshop will clarify the directive's implications and prepare your organization for seamless adaptation. What will you learn By attending this practical 1-day course you will: Gain detailed knowledge of AIFMD 2 amendments and their implications on market participants Assess the impact on fund structures, reporting, and operational processes Understand new reportin"

The Middle East pharmaceutical market size was estimated at USD 57.05 Billion in 2025 and is projected to reach USD 78.30 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 4.04% fom 2025 to 2033. The market is fueled by the growing prevalence of chronic diseases, an aging population, and increased healthcare expenditures. The pharmaceutical market in the Middle East is undergoing notable transformation due to strategic reforms and a growing focus on local production, technological integration, and evolving regulatory standards. In January 2025, the UAE's Emirates Drug Establishment (EDE) introduced new regulations under Federal Decree-Law No. 38/2024, which provides an accelerated approval process for innovative drugs, including biosimilars. This policy aims to address the rising demand for cost-effective treatments for chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. The fast-track approval process for biosimilars is expected to significantly lower drug prices and improve accessibility across the region. This move has been regarded as a critical development in enabling broader access to biologics in the Middle East, where healthcare expenditure has been rising sharply. Another major factor influencing the region's pharmaceutical market is the increasing incidence of chronic diseases. The EMRO region has the highest prevalence of diabetes globally, ranging from 7% in Somalia to 18% in Egypt. In addition, countries such as Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates report high rates of overweight and obesity, exceeding 70%, particularly among women. Physical inactivity rates are also elevated, with about 50% of women an"

    "content": "Columbus, Ohio, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Gardner School of Dublin (TGS), a nationally accredited provider of early childhood education, brought families and community members together for its first Steps of Hope event, a one-mile color run/walk benefiting Nationwide Children’s Hospital Pediatric Research. The event took place on October 4 and included more than 75 participants and raised $2,000 to advance life-changing research that helps more than 1.9 million children each year. The color walk was made possible through generous community support sponsors, including 101 Craft Kitchen, BMI Federal Credit Union, and Whit’s Frozen Custard, with raffle prizes and coupons donated by Nothing Bundt Cakes, Goldfish Swim School, Little Ladies Soft Serve, Zen Hen, Color Me Mine and ZipZone Outdoor Adventures. “Steps of Hope represents what we value most at The Gardner School, providing support and hope to families and children in our community,” said Dean Pappous, CEO of The Gardner School. “Every donation helped children who are bravely fighting cancer, and every child who participated learned what it means to make a difference. At its heart, that’s what The Gardner School is all about, bringing families together to make the world a better place.” Held at Coffman Park and concluding with a family celebration at The Gardner School of Dublin, the event was filled with activities that encouraged community connection and giving. TGS will continue to partner with organizations across the country to support families in communities where its schools are located. “It was incredible to see our families come together to support Nationwide Children’s Hospital,” said Jessica Nix, Director of The Gardner School of Dublin. “So many families have been touched by the care this hospital provides, and events like this give us a meaningful way to give back. It’s a reminder that when we rally around a cause that helps children and families, our community grows stronger together.”"

    "content": "SANTA BARBARA, Calif., Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Raw Garden, California’s leader in clean cannabis for over a decade, has just announced the acquisition of the California Love cannabis brand in a move focused on increasing access to clean and safe cannabis across the state. The deal comes as part of Raw Garden’s highly selective approach to growth and partnerships, rooted in the ethos of supporting small farms who are values-aligned, connected to their communities, and meet their highest standards. Founded in 2015, Raw Garden has been a part of the Clean Green Certification Program since the beginning. They remain committed to testing for hundreds of pesticides and potential contaminants, far more than the 66 currently required by the state, and offer 100% transparency by publishing all results on their website. Earlier this year they also helped launch ECCO (Environmentally Conscious Consumer Organization), because the cannabis industry needed a higher standard - one built on safety, purity, and sustainability. For Raw Garden, clean isn’t just a buzzword, it’s an obsession. Every farm and facility undergoes rigorous compliance checks to ensure that when you choose Raw Garden, you’re choosing clean, contaminant-free cannabis every time. “The purchase of California Love will expand the clean cannabis movement as well as serve as inspiration for others who want to make the switch to clean farming practices,” said Thomas Martin, CEO of Raw Garden. “We are excited about the growth we have seen with California Love, and the goal with this purchase is to provide easier access for people who want clean, pure Cannabis flower.” Based in Grover Beach, California Love is currently available in over 130 retailers throughout the state. Going forward, the brand will be subject to the same rigorous standards as Raw Garden and undergo the same third party testing to ensure consumers of both brands enjoy the same clean quality and attention to detail. ”For us, the certific"

    "content": "Dublin, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Age-Related Macular Degeneration: Epidemiology Forecast to 2034\" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) remains a focal point in ophthalmology due to its status as the leading cause of irreversible vision loss in older adults. Classified into early, intermediate, and late stages, AMD's most advanced phase includes late dry AMD (geographic atrophy) and wet AMD (neovascular AMD). A meta-analysis highlights a prevalence of 8.69% among adults aged 45-85, but rates can climb to 30-40% in certain regions. The condition profoundly affects quality of life and emotional health, demanding attention in public health initiatives. In 2024, 13,788,126 new AMD cases were recorded in people aged 50 and older across seven major markets (7MM). The United States reported the highest number with 3,378,351 cases, while Germany had the least at 1,160,172. Projections indicate a rise to 15,349,696 cases by 2034, growing at an annual rate of 1.13%. Concurrently, AMD's total prevalence across these regions reached 93,262,936 cases in 2024, with the US leading at 23,514,756 cases. Expected to increase to 103,016,570 by 2034, this data underscores the need for enhanced monitoring and intervention strategies. Report Scope: The report delivers insights into risk factors, comorbidities, and historical trends for AMD across the 7MM: US, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, and Japan. Forecasts include diagnosed incident cases, total prevalence (diagnosed and undiagnosed), and subtypes segmented by AMD stage, sex, and age group: 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80+ years. Analysis is bolstered by high-quality, country-specific data and peer-reviewed research, employing primary market research when data gaps exist. Reasons to Buy: Understand AMD market dynamics to formulate effective business strategies. Accurately quantify patient populations to optimize product development, pricing, and launch plans.

This kind of care improves access, medication adherence and provides resources for aging well.” Nearly one-third of Arizona’s population – approximately 2.3 million people – identify as Hispanic, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Suvida’s model aims to meet the needs of this growing demographic through holistic, bilingual care that addresses the physical, behavioral, social and cultural aspects of health. “Partnering with Alignment Health Plan allows us to bring our mission of culturally connected care to more older adults in Arizona,” said Dr. Ana Fuentevilla, co-founder and chief health officer at Suvida Healthcare. “We are proud to offer primary care that meets our patients where they are – geographically, socially and emotionally. Together, we are removing barriers that have long prevented older adults, especially in Hispanic communities, from accessing the care they need and deserve.” To meet the diverse needs of its members, Alignment has long invested in culturally tailored solutions that go beyond language. Its el ÚNICO (“The ONE”) plan was designed specifically for Hispanic seniors, offering bilingual services and benefits that reflect the community’s values and preferences.

    "content": "Charleston, SC, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The way we understand the brain has changed—shouldn’t the way we treat it? Advances in modern neuroscience allow us to see and measure brain function, while our growing knowledge of neuroplasticity shows that brain activity can be changed and improved. These breakthroughs are transforming both diagnosis and treatment. In his new book, Making the Invisible Visible , clinician and brain imaging expert Anthony Silver shows how quantitative EEG (qEEG) “brain mapping” and neurofeedback are revolutionizing care for ADHD, autism, depression, anxiety, trauma, and concussion. Accessible, compelling, and deeply personal, Making the Invisible Visible highlights the limitations of today’s trial-and-error psychiatry and offers a vision of care guided by neuroscience. It is a glimpse into the near future, when a device to record brain function will be as ubiquitous as a stethoscope—when treating the brain without seeing it would be “unthinkable.” Making the Invisible Visible has been enthusiastically reviewed by some of the world’s leading clinicians, and by parents and general readers. It is available for purchase online at Amazon.com and BarnesandNoble.com . For more information, visit GrayMatters.com or follow on Facebook (Gray Matters CT) and Instagram (@graymattersct). About the Author: Anthony Silver is the founder and director of Gray Matters, a network of clinics dedicated to integrating neuroscience into mental health care. He is one of around 100 clinicians worldwide awarded Diplomate status by the International qEEG Certification Board and has treated tens of thousands of patients over nearly two decades. A frequent contributor to The New York Times and an invited speaker at the Society of Brain Mapping and Therapeutics, Silver is recognized internationally for his pioneering work in qEEG brain mapping and neurofeedback. About Gray Matters Gray Matters was founded in 2008 to bring advances in neuroscience into everyda"

    "content": "Hyderabad, India, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global shrimp market is worth USD 127.3 billion in 2025 and is expected to reach USD 136.3 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 1.38%. The shrimp market is shifting towards land-based recirculating aquaculture systems as traditional open-pond methods face risks from climate change and disease. Vertically integrated producers are gaining an edge by managing supply chains end-to-end from inputs to distribution, while sustainability-focused sourcing, especially in Europe, is reshaping trade flows. Pink shrimp currently leads the market, with tiger shrimp showing strong growth.  Despite being highly fragmented, the market offers ample room for innovation and differentiation among small and mid-sized players. Shrimp Market Shifts and Emerging Narrative The shrimp industry’s evolution reflects a broader global food transition. As consumers increasingly prioritize protein-rich diets, shrimp is gaining popularity as a low-fat, nutrient-dense option. Its versatility across cuisines and affordability compared to meat or poultry have strengthened its appeal among health-conscious demographics. Sustainability is at the core of this transformation. Certifications like the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) and Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) are now prerequisites for major importers, ensuring environmental accountability. Simultaneously, vertically integrated operations—spanning hatcheries, feed production, processing, and export—are enhancing transparency and supply chain efficiency. Evolving Consumer and Industry Trends Shift in Consumption Channels: Online seafood delivery platforms and premium retail brands are accelerating off-trade sales growth, complementing traditional foodservice demand. Rising Demand for Processed Formats: Ready-to-cook frozen and canned shrimp products are capturing a growing market share due to convenience and shelf stability. Comprehensive Segmental Overview The shrimp market is segmente"

    "content": "RIYAD, Arabie saoudite,  21 oct. 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dans une avancée historique pour la robotique médicale, le King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre (KFSHRC) de Riyad a réalisé avec succès la première résection robotisée au monde d’une tumeur intracrânienne, une réussite remarquable qui établit une nouvelle norme mondiale en matière de précision et de récupération en neurochirurgie. L’intervention a été réalisée sur un homme de 68 ans souffrant de fortes céphalées et de troubles de la concentration. Elle a consisté à retirer une tumeur cérébrale de 4,5 centimètres à l’aide de bras robotisés. Le patient a quitté l’hôpital pleinement conscient moins de 24 heures après l’intervention, soit un temps de rétablissement quatre fois plus rapide qu’après une chirurgie traditionnelle. Selon les responsables de l’hôpital, la robotique médicale utilisée pour la résection a permis de minimiser le traumatisme chirurgical et d’accélérer la récupération. D’après le Dr Homoud Aldahash, consultant de Skull Base Tumors au KFSHRC, qui a pratiqué l’intervention, souligne que le système robotisé a offert une précision et un contrôle exceptionnels, garantissant une navigation sûre parmi les structures neurovasculaires critiques. « La sortie du patient le jour même, pleinement conscient et sans complications, représente un nouveau point de référence en matière d’innovation neurochirurgicale », a-t-il ajouté. Cette intervention chirurgicale d’une heure a été réalisée à l’aide de bras robotiques guidés par un système optique 3D, permettant aux chirurgiens d’opérer avec une visualisation nette et détaillée du cerveau. L’utilisation d’une technologie avancée de navigation guidée par l’image a permis d’assurer l’ablation précise de la tumeur tout en protégeant les zones vitales du cerveau. Le Dr Majid Alfayyadh, PDG du KFSHRC, a vu dans cette prouesse une étape clé de la transformation de l’hôpital. « Cette avancée reflète le rôle croissant du KFSHRC dans le développement f"

    "content": "Dublin, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Viral Vector Manufacturing Markets and Technologies Through 2030\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The global market for viral vector manufacturing is expected to grow from $6.3 billion in 2025 and is projected to reach $18.8 billion by the end of 2030, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24.6% during the forecast period of 2025 to 2030. The use of viral vectors in gene therapy is transforming healthcare, with an increase in the demand for Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) grade materials. The process of bringing a viral vector from concept to clinic requires extensive optimization and characterization, affecting every stage from cell culture to purification and concentration. Variations in vector titer during the upstream phase may result from the specific transgene being packaged or from constitutive or \"leaky\" tissue-specific promoters, which can induce unintended protein expression, and, in turn, impact vector yield and quality. Therefore, increasing the production of GMP-grade materials is crucial to meet the growing demand for clinical applications. Market Dynamics and Growth Factors Viral-based vectors are at the core of cell and gene therapy, enabling researchers and clinicians to develop powerful drug platforms. Over the past five years, regulatory approvals for viral vector-based drugs have surged, ranging from cancer therapies to treatments for monogenic diseases. The three dominant vector strategies are adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses, and lentiviruses, which have led to preclinical and clinical breakthroughs over the last two decades. Market drivers include the increasing incidence of chronic diseases, rising approvals of vector-based therapies, and growing demand for viral vector production. Market restraints include the process and cost barriers in viral vector development, roadblocks with viral vectors, and the high cost linked with viral vector production. Repo"

The German E-bike Market was valued at USD 8.67 Billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 13.83 Billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 8.10%. The Germany E-bike market is witnessing strong momentum driven by increasing consumer preference for eco-friendly transportation, rising fuel prices prompting a shift toward cost-efficient mobility, and continuous advancements in electric drivetrain and battery technologies that enhance range and reliability. Growth drivers include supportive government policies promoting electric mobility adoption, expanding availability of innovative designs catering to both urban commuters and recreational riders, and the integration of smart features such as GPS navigation, app connectivity, and anti-theft systems. For instance, by the end of 2024, Germany had approximately 15.7 million e-bikes in use, exceeding the political target of 15 million. This represents an eightfold increase over the past decade, fueled by rising adoption across diverse categories such as trekking, cargo, and city bikes. The growth is attributed to improved product availability, better technology, and consumer preference for eco-friendly commuting. Despite this surge, market saturation has not yet been reached as many households still own older bicycles, leaving room for replacement demand. Market Drivers: Rising Demand for Sustainable Personal Mobility The growing global emphasis on reducing carbon emissions and minimizing environmental impact is steering consumers toward sustainable transportation solutions, with e-bikes emerging as a preferred choice. Riders are increasingly drawn to e-bikes for their ability to offer zero tailpipe emissions, lower lifetime operational costs, and reduced dependence on fossil fuels. The appeal is heightened by the convenience of integrating"

These capabilities, the first in Pear Deck’s new Student Toolbox, mark the beginning of a multi-phase rollout aimed at providing students with direct, in-the-moment accessibility support. As the flagship product within the comprehensive Pear Deck Learning platform, Pear Deck is loved by educators nationwide, with 97% of teachers agreeing it supports active learning by helping students stay engaged and participate meaningfully in lessons. With the addition of translation and read-aloud capabilities, Pear Deck now empowers ELLs to follow along in real time without leaving the interactive lesson experience teachers and students already know and love. Madison Weidner, first-grade teacher at PS 142 Amalia Castro, a New York City public school in District 1, has already seen transformative results: \"Pear Deck’s audio recording tool creates translated summaries of my lessons so my ELLs feel engaged and included. With translation and read-aloud features built right in, I no longer have to spend extra time translating materials. My students can now follow along more easily, understand what’s happening in real time, and participate confidently with their peers while hearing lessons in both English and their home language. I’m excited to see my ELLs continue making strides in reading thanks to this new feature!\" The new tools address a critical need identified during one of the GoGuardian team’s regular school visits, where educators shared concerns about ELLs struggling to keep pace during live Pear Deck sessions.

On October 15, 2025, AL filed a preliminary proxy with the SEC concerning the proposed sale. Based on our review of the preliminary proxy, we have renewed our investigation into whether there are any undisclosed potential conflicts of interest. Additionally, we remain concerned that the sale price is well below the target price of $72.00 per share set on August 6, 2025, by Wall Street analyst Jamie Baker of J.P. Morgan. Further, it has been observed that the sale appears to be at a discount to book value.

    "content": "Saint-Genis-Pouilly, France, 21 October 2025 – Step Pharma (“the Company”), the global leader in CTPS1 inhibition for targeted cancer treatment, today announces that its Chief Scientific Officer, Philip Beer, will be presenting data on the identification of a CTPS1-dependent synthetic lethality in solid tumours at the 2025 EORTC-NCI-AACR International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics, being held from 22-26 October in Boston, MA. The presentation will focus on the use of the AACR Project GENIE data, a publicly accessible cancer registry of real-world clinico-genomic data, to identify loss of CTPS2 as a novel biomarker to select solid tumours with a synthetic lethal dependency on CTPS1. Deletion of CTPS2 was subsequently identified as a frequent event in many cancer types, with the highest prevalence found in ovarian cancer. As tumours derived from epithelial tissues can utilise both CTPS1 and CTPS2 in the final step of the CTP synthesis cascade, loss of CTPS2 in solid tumours exposes a dependence which could be targeted with CTPS1 inhibition to prevent tumour cell proliferation. As a result of these findings, dencatistat, an orally available and highly potent inhibitor of CTPS1, which is currently being evaluated in a phase 1a dose escalation study in patients with solid tumours, will be evaluated in safety expansion cohorts in patients with CTPS2 null cancers, with the first being ovarian cancer (NCT06297525). Selecting patients whose tumours have deleted CTPS2 represents a precision oncology approach that is expected to maximise the therapeutic potential of dencatistat. Philip Beer, Chief Scientific Officer of Step Pharma, said: “Our work analysing clinico-genomic data led us to identify patients with CTPS2 null solid tumours as a promising therapeutic application for dencatistat. About 15-20% of ovarian cancers harbour this deletion, and so through inhibition of CTPS1 with dencatistat, we can selectively target the de novo pyrimidine synthes"

Life Extension introduces Migra-Health™ , the first science-based supplement created in collaboration with Minded, Inc., a new wellness brand created by award-winning actor/director Sydney Scotia and her team of leading neurologists, physicians, and scientists. “This started with my own struggles. I know firsthand how debilitating head discomfort can be,” Scotia explained, adding that “ Migra-Health™ is about giving millions of people the chance to feel in charge of their brain health and to finally have an accessible option that puts relief—and hope—back in their hands. ” According to Kristen Dominguez, PhD, a Discovery Research Scientist at Life Extension , Migra-Health™ is designed for daily use to help lessen the frequency and duration of head discomfort with clinically studied ingredients. “We worked with Minded experts to identify the key ingredients in Migra-Health™ ,” she explained. “This comprehensive supplement delivers a combination of B vitamins, vitamin D3, magnesium and CoQ10, each shown in clinical studies to relieve those bouts of head discomfort that can disrupt someone’s routine.” For example, in a randomized controlled trial, participants taking 50 mcg (2000 IU) of vitamin D3 for three months reported 36% minimized frequency and 27% shorter duration of head discomfort compared to placebo. What’s more, vitamin D also appeared to help maintain already-healthy serum levels of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a neuropeptide associated with head discomfort. In another clinical trial, participants taking 300 mg of CoQ10 for three months reported 26% lower head discomfort frequency than the placebo group. Life Extension’s Director of Education, Michael A. Smith, MD , said these nutrients work because they support the normal function of certain networks in the brain, nerve endings and blood vessels att"

This milestone — reaching 100 advisor practices with approximately $50 billion in prehire assets and $350 million in revenue — firmly positions &Partners among the fastest-growing hybrid broker-dealer and RIA wealth management firms in the country. “We founded &Partners with a bold vision: to create an environment where advisors are empowered as owners, and clients receive truly personalized advice,” said David Kowach , CEO and cofounder of &Partners. “Welcoming the Mannen Financial Group as our 100th practice is more than just a number. It confirms that advisors are embracing our ownership model and our mission to change financial lives for the better.” Advisor ownership drives growth Unlike many of its competitors, &Partners is uniquely structured as an advisor- and employee-owned firm with a broad distribution of equity. Advisors who join become owners, creating alignment across advisors, clients, and the home office team. This shared ownership model has been a powerful driver of &Partners’ rapid growth — helping attract 100 advisor practices in two years. &Partners has a particularly strong track record of attracting women advisors. Thirty percent of the practices who have joined &Partners were founded by a women, and 40% include at least one woman advisor — well above the industry average. Elizabeth Mannen Berges, founder of the Mannen Financial Group | &Partners, said: “We chose &Partners because their philosophy matches ours: integrity, professionalism, and a relentless focus on the client. The opportunity to be both an advisor and an owner makes this partnership especially meaningful.” David Kowach shared, “I’m delighted that Elizabeth and her team have joined us. They’re an incredible multigene"

    "content": "CHICAGO, IL, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As U.S. consumers embrace baking, the cookbook shelf is heating up. While the overall cookbook category remains flat in 2025, baking cookbooks are proving to be the breakout stars, according to Circana , LLC. Unit sales of baking cookbooks are up by more than 80% in 2025, versus last year. With over 800,000 baking cookbooks sold in the past 12 months, this growth reflects a broader consumer shift toward home baking as both a hobby and tradition – especially as the holiday season approaches. “Sweet Tooth” by Sarah Fennel is currently leading the growth in sales this year, but the momentum extends beyond a single bestseller. A closer look at the top-performing baking cookbooks reveals several key themes driving consumer interest: Skill Building : Many of the fastest-growing titles focus on making baking approachable – offering reliable, tested recipes that build confidence in the kitchen Small-Batch Recipes : Reflecting a desire for indulgence in moderation, several books feature scaled-down recipes in smaller quantities and perfect for everyday enjoyment Dietary Inclusivity : With gluten-free, dairy-free, and egg-free options increasingly common, other top growing titles cater to various dietary needs, ensuring that baking is tastily accessible to all Comfort and Nostalgia : Familiar or vintage recipes tap into the emotional connections and cherished traditions associated with baked goods “These cookbook subject trends suggest that consumers are seeking an accessible and personalized home baking experience that balances indulgence with practicality,” said Brenna Connor, books industry analyst at Circana . “People are baking for pleasure and for skill-building while balancing wellness and dietary requirements. Emotional fulfillment and creating meaningful experiences also play a role.” The increase in baking cookbook sales mirrors a broader trend: baking at home is outperforming bakery sales, Circana data shows.

The United Kingdom Ready-to-Drink (RTD) Tea and Coffee Market is expected to grow to US$ 928.84 million by 2033, from US$ 580.57 million in 2024, at a CAGR of 5.36% between 2025 and 2033. Market growth is driven by increasing demand for handy, on-the-go drinks, health consciousness, and the popularity of flavored and functional RTD tea and coffee among urban, busy consumers in the UK. In the UK, RTD tea and coffee have become widely popular because of the demands for convenient and healthier drink options. Iced teas are hugely promoted as low-calorie and antioxidant drinks, drawing in health-conscious consumers. RTD coffee in the form of cold brew and already prepared lattes is especially favored by young professionals who want a quick jolt of caffeine without going to the cafes. The UK's increasing cafe culture, as well as increasing diversity of flavors and functional drinks, has also contributed further to market adoption. Premiumization, organic flavor, and sugar-free versions Drivers of the growth in the United Kingdom RTD Tea and Coffee Market Increase in Demand for Ready-to-Drink Beverages The UK's fast lifestyle has made consumers prefer ready-to-drink (RTD) drinks that need no preparation. RTD coffee and tea are perfect for professionals, students, and travelers looking for instant refreshment. The convenience of single-serve bottles and cans being widely available in hypermarkets, convenience stores, and online channels further fueled consumption and drove market growth.

The U.S. large molecule drug substance CDMO market size was estimated at USD 13.08 Billion in 2025 and is projected to reach USD 22.56 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 7.06% from 2025 to 2033. This market is experiencing significant growth due to the growing prevalence of chronic diseases, further driving the demand for biologics such as monoclonal antibodies, cell therapies, and gene therapies. Moreover, increasing outsourcing trends by pharmaceutical and biotech companies to reduce costs, access specialized expertise, and accelerate commercialization are also some of the factors contributing to the market growth. The market is driven by the growing demand for biologics to meet the growing demand for effective therapeutic options for chronic and complex diseases. The increasing prevalence of cancer, autoimmune disorders, and metabolic diseases globally is leading to the growing demand for more advanced therapies. Biologics such as monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins, cell therapies, and gene therapies have emerged as prominent solutions, but their development and manufacturing processes are comparatively complex and require advanced infrastructure. Therefore, several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies increasingly turn to contract development and manufacturing organizations to streamline operations and address the growing complexity of large molecule drug development. Thus, these factors would help companies to reduce the burden of high capital investments, avoid lengthy facility set-ups, and gain faster access to specialized expertise that ensures regulatory compliance and high-quality production.

    "content": "NEW YORK, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Altamirano PLLC continues to investigate investor losses tied to GWG L Bonds following the latest developments in GWG Holdings’ Chapter 11 bankruptcy and ongoing FINRA arbitration claims against the brokerage firms that recommended and sold the bonds. On September 24, 2025, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas held a hearing on preliminary approval of a $50.5 million settlement related to GWG Holdings’ Director and Officer (D&O) Adversary Proceeding. The settlement also resolves claims brought in a related securities class action. The following day, the Court entered an order preliminarily approving the settlement, with a final fairness hearing scheduled for January 13, 2026. According to court filings, the Litigation Trustee determined that further litigation against the insured defendants would be unlikely to produce a more favorable result for bondholders, given the risks, delays, and diminishing insurance coverage under the D&O policies. The settlement does not address the GWG Litigation Trust’s separate recovery efforts involving more than $140 million in additional claims, which remain ongoing. Brokerage firms and financial advisors marketed the GWG L Bonds as safe, income-generating investments backed by life insurance portfolios. After GWG filed for bankruptcy in 2022, investors discovered the extent of firms’ due diligence failures, inadequate training, and other sales practice violations. Many brokerage firms recommended GWG L Bonds to customers without regard for suitability. Investors who wanted to earn income safely without risking their principal were left facing devastating losses. Investment fraud lawyer Jorge Altamirano commented, “The settlement is an important step, but it underscores that GWG L Bond investors will recover only pennies on the dollar through the bankruptcy case. Meaningful recovery remains possible only by pursuing individual claims in FINRA arbitration ag"

Dr. de Carvalho is an assistant professor in the Department of Urology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. The Rising Stars in Urology Research Award program was established in 2005 to encourage recipients to contribute to urology as surgical specialists and scientists investigating causes, prevention, treatment, and cures that will improve patient’s lives. The research grant program provides up to five years of supplemental salary support to urologists who have successfully competed for career development awards from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) or other major funding organizations. “Dr. de Carvalho’s project exemplifies the kind of translational science that bridges laboratory discovery with clinical impact,” said Henry Lai, MD, chair of the AUA Research Council. “He is laying the groundwork for more precise and effective bladder cancer therapies, and it’s research like this that moves the field forward in meaningful ways.” Dr. de Carvalho’s research aims to improve treatment outcomes for bladder cancer patients by targeting tumor-associated macrophages, immune cells that can block the effectiveness of immunotherapy. By focusing on these cells, the project seeks to enhance the impact of chemo-immunotherapy and identify which patient subgroups are most likely to benefit from macrophage-directed therapies. The findings will offer valuable insights into overcoming resistance to current treatments, helping clinicians better match patients with therapies that are most likely to succeed. \"Dr. de Carvalho’s research focuses on potentially lethal muscle-invasive bladder cancer, which may not be responsive to combination chemo-immunotherapy,\" stated Dr. Nagler, president of the Urol"

Med base i København får Lantz ansvaret for at drive TrueCommerces strategi inden for elektronisk fakturering, regulatorisk compliance og automatisering af finansielle processer i Europa. Fokus på compliance og automatisering I sin nye rolle skal Lantz adressere nogle af de største udfordringer, virksomheder står overfor inden for e-fakturering. Et centralt fokus bliver at udvikle compliance-by-design-løsninger, der automatisk tilpasser sig nye lovkrav, understøtter sikre digitale signaturer og leverer pålidelige revisionsspor. Han vil samtidig hjælpe virksomheder med at overholde landespecifikke krav som Peppol og nye nationale platforme på tværs af Europa – og dermed gøre det lettere at sikre compliance i komplekse markeder. Integration og effektivitet i focus En anden vigtig indsats bliver at sikre sømløs integration til ERP-systemer som SAP, Microsoft Dynamics 365, Sage og NetSuite – en forudsætning for effektive processer på tværs af globale forsyningskæder. Derudover vil Lantz arbejde for at optimere de finansielle arbejdsgange fra faktura til betaling, så virksomheder kan reducere risici, opnå bedre indsigt og øge effektiviteten. ”At investere i fleksible og fremtidssikrede e-faktureringsløsninger handler ikke kun om at opfylde lovkrav,” siger Lantz. ”Det handler om at give virksomheder bedre gennemsigtighed, effektivitet og robusthed i deres CTC-processer. Jeg ser frem til at blive en del af TrueCommerce og hjælpe kunder med at omsætte regulatoriske krav til konkrete vækstmuligheder.” Erfaring fra finansiel teknologi Før han kom til TrueCommerce, arbejdede Lantz næsten fire år hos Euronext Securities i København, hvor h"

Sun Ghee has received funding to achieve Non-GMO Project verification for its line of herb and spice-infused ghee products. The Denver, CO-based company was born from founder Farnosh Family's personal journey toward healing through food. After experiencing health challenges, she turned to ghee as a nourishing source of healthy fat and began infusing it with herbs and spices at home. What started as personal recovery became a mission to honor traditional food practices, while introducing this time-tested superfood to more kitchens across the U.S. through creative flavor combinations. \"I started making ghee for my own healing and began sharing it with friends who kept coming back for more,\" said Family. \"Our products celebrate how food travels with people across cultures. We're taking ghee, traditionally used from South Asia to Africa, and infusing it with global herbs and spices to create something that reflects the immigrant experience and honors the movement of food traditions.\" Sun Ghee makes integrating ghee into meals approachable by using familiar herb combinations that provide context for home cooks. Products featuring flavors such as rosemary and sage help even the burgeoning home chef understand how to incorporate this nutritious fat into everyday cooking, from roasted potatoes to elevated grilled cheese sandwiches. The company sources its dairy exclusively from grass-fed organic farms with regenerative agricultural practices, reflecting both brands' commitment to food system integrity. Sun Ghee used the Equitable Transfer Program funding to pursue Non-GMO Project verification for its entire product line. For animal-derived products like ghee, this verification traces the non-GMO commitment all t"

    "content": "CHICAGO, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Giordano’s , Chicago’s iconic deep-dish pizza brand, announced today the official launch of its new Tavern-Style Pizza, a thin, crispy, square-cut pizza inspired by one of Chicago’s most beloved styles. The debut coincides with National Tavern-Style Pizza Day on October 22, celebrating a Chicago favorite that has defined the city’s pizza culture for generations. Developed by Giordano’s culinary team, the new Tavern-Style Pizza features an extremely thin crust created using a technique inspired by croissant-making. Giordano’s proprietary Wisconsin mozzarella cheese is folded into the dough, producing a light, flaky texture, and a satisfyingly crunchy bite in every square. “Chicago is a city that takes its pizza seriously, and we're fortunate to have two distinct styles: deep-dish and tavern-style,\" said Nick Scarpino, CEO at Giordano’s. \"Over the past 50 years, our deep-dish has become a symbol of Chicago around the world. Now, we're thrilled to add our incredible tavern-style pizza that will surely become just as famous. The crunch of our tavern-style pizza will become just as iconic as the cheese pull of our stuffed deep-dish pizza.\" For more than 50 years, Giordano’s has been “the 1 for Chicago-style pizza”, earning a reputation for its legendary stuffed deep dish and commitment to quality. With the introduction of Tavern-Style Pizza, the brand continues to honor the traditions that make Chicago the ultimate pizza capital. “Our goal was to capture the essence of Chicago’s tavern-style pizza while adding the craftsmanship and quality people expect from Giordano’s,” said Jesse Harris, Corporate Executive Chef. “It’s thin, crunchy, and loaded with flavor, exactly what a great tavern-style pizza should be.” The Tavern-Style Pizza is available in a variety of classic and specialty combinations for dine-in, carryout, or delivery at participating Giordano’s locations across the Chicagoland area. This new offering joins the bra"

The firm provides comprehensive legal advocacy to help injury victims navigate complex claims processes, addressing the physical, financial, and emotional challenges that arise after serious accidents. Warnock Law offers legal representation for car accident and slip and fall victims across Gilbert, Tempe, and Peoria. Car accidents and slip and fall incidents frequently result in serious injuries such as broken bones, head trauma, spinal cord damage, and internal injuries. Victims often face mounting medical expenses, lost wages, and lasting pain that can significantly disrupt daily life. By pursuing personal injury claims, the firm ensures that clients receive the advocacy required to secure compensation for both economic damages and non-economic losses, including medical care, rehabilitation, and reduced quality of life. Slip and fall accidents commonly occur due to hazardous property conditions, inadequate maintenance, or failure to provide safe environments. Establishing liability in these injury cases often requires a thorough examination of the accident scene, collection of evidence, and review of witness statements. By working with medical professionals, accident reconstruction experts, and financial analysts, Warnock Mackinlay Law strengthens each claim, ensuring that the impact of negligence is fully documented and presented in settlement negotiations or trial. Car accident claims involve an equally complex set of legal considerations. Insurance companies often challenge liability, minimize settlement offers, or dispute the extent of injuries. A personal injury attorney can counter these tactics by investigating accident reports, securing video footage, analyzing traffic laws, and consulting with medical experts. The"

The global fertility test market size was estimated at USD 7.92 Billion in 2025 and is projected to reach USD 14.74 billion in 2033, growing at a CAGR of 8.08% from 2025 to 2033. This growth is attributed to lifestyle changes, higher stress levels, delayed pregnancies, and exposure to environmental pollutants. In addition, there is a growing awareness of reproductive health and greater acceptance of fertility testing among both men and women, which encourages early diagnosis and intervention. Moreover, the rising prevalence of reproductive disorders, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and endometriosis, is encouraging more individuals to seek evaluations. The increasing rates of infertility among both men and women are a significant factor driving the growth of the market. As per the report published by the World Health Organization (WHO) in April 2023, infertility affects approximately 1 in 6 adults, or 17.5% of the population. The report indicates that infertility rates are consistent across various regions and income levels, with a lifetime prevalence of 17.8% in high-income countries and 16.5% in low- and middle-income countries. This suggests that infertility is not confined to specific demographics or areas, making it a serious challenge for people worldwide.

As the global legal and financial landscape grows increasingly complex, these strategies are becoming central to effective wealth preservation and risk mitigation for high-liability individuals and business owners. Donlevy-Rosen & Rosen, P.A. highlights offshore trust asset protection as a vital legal strategy for professionals facing heightened litigation and financial exposure risks. In an era marked by expanding liability exposure, professionals in fields such as medicine, law, business, and finance are recognizing the importance of proactive asset protection planning. Offshore trusts, structured within compliant and legally sound jurisdictions, provide a strategic framework that separates personal wealth from potential claims, ensuring long-term preservation and control. This form of legal planning enables individuals and business owners to maintain stability while mitigating the risks associated with professional practice, business disputes, and personal liability. Unlike traditional domestic arrangements, offshore asset protection trusts offer an additional layer of protection through jurisdictional independence and established legal principles designed to shield assets from aggressive litigation tactics. By integrating such trusts into a broader estate and financial plan, wealth holders can enhance privacy, maintain control over distributions, and ensure the continuity of asset management in alignment with future goals. Asset protection strategies often encompass multiple layers, including business entity formation, domestic and offshore trusts, and real estate asset protection structures. When effectively coordinated, these mechanisms"

    "content": "ATLANTA, GA, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Even though ransomware extortion cooled slightly in Q3 2025 (-8.77%), cybercriminals show no signs of slowing down. According to the upcoming “Q3 2025 Threat Landscape Report” from PDI Security and Network Solutions , dark web activity climbed 5.63%, while overall exploit attempts spiked nearly 84% (83.69%) compared to the previous quarter—underscoring how attackers continue to evolve and expand their reach. The new report examines threat trends across multiple industries, with data sourced from more than a trillion traffic logs across PDI customer sites worldwide. Expert analysis reveals that while extortions against retail organizations dropped 8.77% from Q2 to Q3 2025, the long-term picture tells a more troubling story: Ransomware extortions against retail are up 96.55% year-over-year (Q3 2024 to Q3 2025). These extortions can grind business operations to a halt, particularly for 24-hour retailers, and lead to payment fraud, potential PCI DSS compliance violations, costly downtime, and lasting damage to customer trust and loyalty. “The data shows that cybercriminals are evolving just as fast as the technologies retailers depend on,” said Josh Smith, Supervisor of Threat Intelligence at PDI Security and Network Solutions and author of the report. “The retail sector remains an attractive target because of its distributed environments, reliance on third-party systems, frequent employee turnover, and high transaction volumes.” Security, IT, and convenience leaders can gain exclusive insights and practical guidance to strengthen their cybersecurity posture by joining the upcoming live briefing on Thursday, October 30, 2025, at 2 pm ET.

It is available via EnBath’s Amazon storefront and directly through Amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQ9WH86T and enbath.com . Enbath's New Patent Pending Cover Design The cover redesign was deemed unique enough to warrant a design-patent filing, reflecting EnBath’s emphasis on balancing aesthetics and function. While the entire unit underwent a comprehensive redesign, the lid mechanism stands out for its improved durability, refined appearance, and ease of maintenance. “We approached this as more than a refresh,  we rethought every element, but the cover truly became the centerpiece of innovation,” said Darren Reynolds, CEO of EnBath. “Facility managers and custodial teams deserve equipment that looks good, lasts long, and simplifies upkeep. This design reflects our commitment to quality bathroom products for both commercial and home settings.” Constructed from corrosion-resistant brushed stainless steel, the new dispenser supports dual jumbo rolls to reduce refill frequency and ease operational burden. Removable spindles allow adaptability across both standard and high-capacity jumbo roll cores, giving procurement teams greater flexibility. In high-use restroom environments, this design aims to lower the total cost of ownership by minimizing downtime and routine maintenance.

    "content": "Toms River, New Jersey , Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Judah Spinner , Founder of BlackBird Financial LP , has unveiled a substantial new investment in Tidewater Inc. , the world’s largest operator and owner of offshore support vessels (OSVs). The move underscores BlackBird Financial’s conviction in the rapidly improving economics of the offshore support sector. BlackBird Financial LP “The OSV landscape is in a completely different place than it was ten years ago,” said Judah Spinner . “Among all players in the field, Tidewater stands out as the strongest, and no other competitor comes close.” The position, established early in 2025, contributed to an outstanding first three quarters for BlackBird Financial , which has delivered a 71.4% return in the period, exceeding the S&P 500 by more than 57 percentage points. Why BlackBird Financial Chose Tidewater Founded in 1956, Tidewater has long been integral to global offshore energy operations, providing vessels that transport equipment, supplies, and personnel to oil and gas platforms across the world. While the OSV sector has historically been cyclical and capital intensive, Judah Spinner believes the landscape has fundamentally changed. “In 2015 the industry was oversupplied and fragmented, there were far too many boats and the competitions was vicious” Spinner explained. “Since then, new vessel construction has nearly halted, while roughly 4% of the global fleet retires each year. As a result, total fleet size has contracted dramatically.” Meanwhile, the industry has consolidated. After completing several key acquisitions, Tidewater now hold the #1 spot in the industry. There is far less competition today than early last decade. All of this is clearly reflected in the rising average day rates. And Spinner expects this trend to continue. Day rates would need to increase to $40,000 in order for new builds to be economical. At that level, Tidewater would generate over $1.5 billion in incremental reveue, equal to m"

The project will be delivered through a 20-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), representing a key step in LKQ’s broader sustainability and long-term greenhouse gas emissions reduction strategy. Covering more than 12,000 square metres, the system will feature over 6,000 photovoltaic modules and is expected to generate around 2.7 gigawatt hours of electricity annually, covering up to 50 percent of the site’s electrical energy demand. The system is also capable of saving the equivalent of up to 1,000 metric tonnes of GHG emissions per year compared with conventional grid electricity. Richard Brasher, Vice President, Sustainability at LKQ Corporation, said: “In our 2024 Sustainability Report, we committed to the exploration of PPAs in our central distribution centers to complement our long-term commitment to deliver profitable and sustainable solutions as part of our GHG emissions reduction strategy. This initiative marks a significant step in this journey.” Ecobility Services GmbH will oversee the planning, installation, operation, and maintenance of the rooftop photovoltaic system throughout the term of the agreement. Installation is expected to begin in October and completed by mid-2026. Nicolas Holdschik, Managing Director of Ecobility Services GmbH, said: “With our latest photovoltaic project, we are sending a strong signal for sustainable energy supply in the commercial sector together with LKQ DACH. As a long-standing partner in the PV and LED sector, we are delighted to now be pursuing this path in the PPA model and look forward with confidence to the next 20 years of successful cooperation.” The initiative contributes to LKQ’s long-term roadmap to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

    "content": "SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bitget Wallet , the leading non-custodial crypto wallet, has launched a full gas abstraction system across Solana, TRON, and major EVM-compatible blockchains. The update allows users to cover gas fees using stablecoins like USDT and USDC, or the platform’s native token BGB, eliminating the need to top up gas accounts or to hold native tokens such as ETH, TRX, or SOL. The feature enables token transfers and decentralized swaps with gas fees deducted directly from USDT, USDC or BGB balances at the time of execution. By removing the need to pre-fund network-specific gas tokens, Bitget Wallet aligns the self-custodial experience more closely with that of centralized platforms. The gas abstraction system is implemented natively in the wallet interface and requires no user activation or separate balances. Users see fees quoted in USDT, USDC or BGB, which are deducted automatically upon transaction. The feature currently supports major EVM chains including Ethereum, BNB Chain, Base, Polygon, Arbitrum and Optimism, in addition to Solana and TRON. Support for additional chains, such as Plasma, Sei, Morph, is in active development. \"Abstracting gas payments is a foundational step toward making self-custody usable at scale,\" said Jamie Elkaleh, Chief Marketing Officer at Bitget Wallet . \"It removes one of the most persistent frictions in Web3 — the need to manage native gas tokens across fragmented ecosystems.\" The underlying infrastructure varies by chain. On EVM networks, Bitget Wallet implements EIP-7702 , enabling stablecoin gas payments by allowing EOAs to delegate execution to smart contract logic. On Solana, it uses the native Paymaster model to bypass the need for SOL, while on TRON, an energy leasing mechanism abstracts gas costs. Each approach removes the need for users to manage native tokens during transactions. This rollout builds on Bitget Wallet's existing gas account system GetGas, which allows user"

Sticker Mule will also be offering a scholarship to 50 employee children in grades K–8. This effort reflects a shared commitment to expanding Catholic education throughout our community. Constantino will also work with the school on a number of innovative improvements to strengthen SMI’s already strong pedagogical foundation. He’ll involve members of his team at Sticker Mule to deliver educational improvements that prepare students for the technological renaissance that we are all currently living through. Parents can apply for admission and scholarship at apply@smik8.org . Students from throughout the Capital District are encouraged to apply. Students will be required to submit a current report card and a 100-word essay on “Why Do I Want to Attend SMI.” Press contact Paul Antonelli paul.antonelli@stickermule.com 518-866-6298 A"

The state-of-the-art facility, located on a 400-acre site, is expected to create 1,500 jobs and will serve as a hub for producing JCB’s telehandlers and mobile elevating work platforms. The project, the single largest investment in the company’s 80-year history, remains on schedule, with hiring set to begin in late-2025 and production launching in mid-2026. Facility Expansion Adds Capacity and Capabilities In April, JCB announced an increase in the size of the San Antonio facility, bringing the total footprint to 1 million square feet. This expansion reflects JCB’s continued confidence in the U.S. market and supports the company’s strategy to increase production closer to customers, improve delivery timelines and reduce supply chain risk. “This expansion highlights our long-term commitment to U.S. manufacturing,” said Richard Fox-Marrs, CEO of JCB North America. “The decision to grow our presence in San Antonio is not only about bricks and mortar. It’s about delivering value to our customers, strengthening our supply chain and investing in the future of American industry.” Site Development Complete Since the groundbreaking in June 2024, JCB has made rapid progress on site preparation and infrastructure. The architectural design is being led by RVK, a women-owned firm with a track record in commercial and industrial projects. R&S Excavation Ltd. completed mass grading, and Ella Contracting led utility work. More than 1 million tons of dirt and 119,000 tons of select fill were moved, and nearly 19,300 linear feet of sewer, water and storm lines installed. “The efficiency and expertise demonstrated by our site development teams have been outstanding,” said David Carver, operations d"

    "content": "Boston, MA, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Samuel Adams , one of the pioneers of craft beer, today unveiled Samuel Adams Utopias 2025, the 14th release of the highly anticipated, barrel-aged extreme beer. Defying convention with a 30% ABV, Utopias 2025 is one of the strongest beers ever brewed, and as a result, is illegal in 15 states. This limited-edition beer is bottled in individually numbered ceramic vessels at a cost of $240 SRP, reflecting the rarity, complexity, and unparalleled craftsmanship of the liquid. Since the introduction of Utopias in 2001, Samuel Adams founder and CEO of Boston Beer Company, Jim Koch, and the award-winning craft beer brewing team set forth two innovation goals: Push the boundaries of barrel-aging techniques and flavor profiles to achieve a boundary-bending, barrel-aged beer that blurs the line between beer and fine spirits with increasingly strong and complex vintages. Reach the auspicious goal of achieving 30% ABV to make it one of the strongest beers in the world. Each Utopias release explores uncharted territory, harnessing new blending techniques and the strength of the Samuel Adams and Boston Beer Brewing team. Most notably, this year, after 14 releases, Utopias 2025 marks a milestone for the team with the achievement of their decades-long goal of 30% ABV. “When we first began the Utopias journey over thirty years ago, we set out to explore the limits of what beer could be,” said Jim Koch, founder and brewer of Samuel Adams. “Reaching 30% ABV is a remarkable milestone for Utopias— not for the number itself, but for what it represents: the relentless pursuit of craft without compromise. Every vintage, barrel, and bottle reflects decades of experimentation, innovation, and collaboration, delivering a sipping experience that is truly unparalleled, collectible, memorable, and worth the wait.” The Challenges of Brewing High ABV Beers The biggest challenge in brewing a high ABV beer is the flavor and quality.

(OTC: RVRC), a biopharmaceutical company developing advanced lipid-based therapeutics for infectious and oncologic diseases, today announced significant progress in its regulatory and manufacturing programs supporting the planned Phase 1 clinical trial of its lead product candidate, Nano-Mupirocin - a novel systemic formulation of the well-known and highly potent antibiotic mupirocin. “Our novel formulation of Nano-Mupirocin is designed to overcome the inherent limitation of mupirocin’s instability in blood and to expand its use beyond topical applications into systemic treatment for severe bacterial infections”, says Amir Avraham, the CEO, - “the formulation aims to maintain therapeutic concentrations in the bloodstream and effectively target deep-tissue infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens such as Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci (VRE), and Ceftriaxone-Resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae”. Last month, the company submitted its clinical trial application to the Israeli Ministry of Health, marking a critical milestone toward the initiation of first-in-human studies in early 2026. Concurrently, Revium Rx, in collaboration with WuXi AppTec, one of the world’s leading global CDMOs, continues to advance the scale-up and production of its GMP clinical batch, with final release expected by the end of 2025. Addressing the Urgent Threat of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) In 2021, Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) was estimated to have caused approximately 130,000 deaths directly attributable to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) — a sharp rise from 57,200 in 1990. According to the Global Research on Antimicrobial Resistance (GRAM) Project published in The Lancet in 2022, MRSA was responsible for over 100,000 AMR-attributable deaths in 2019, making it one of the deadliest pathogens that year.

The United States Rapid Acting Insulin Market will see significant growth, rising from US$ 2.32 Billion in 2024 to US$ 3.40 Billion by 2033 The growth amounts to a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 4.33% between 2025 and 2033. Some of the major drivers for the growth are the increasing prevalence of diabetes, the advancements in insulin delivery systems, and increased interest in personalized solutions for diabetes management. Fast acting insulin is immensely popular because of the rising number of diabetes cases and the growing awareness of effective diabetes control techniques. Patients love the ease of use, which provides greater control over blood glucose levels at meal times, catering to unpredictable eating habits and timings. Furthermore, innovations in insulin formulation and modes of administration, including pens and insulin pumps, have facilitated greater convenience for users. The increasing focus on targeted or personalized medicine and enhancing quality of life in diabetes patients further drives demand for rapid acting insulin, solidifying its position as a mainstay in diabetes management. Growth Drivers in United States Rapid Acting Insulin Market Increasing Prevalence of Diabetes Increased prevalence of diabetes, especially type 2 diabetes, is one of the key growth drivers in the U.S. rapid-acting insulin market. The CDC states that more than 37 million Americans have diabetes, with millions more in prediabetic phases. As the patient population demanding insulin treatment is on the rise, there is greater demand for quickly acting products that manage post-meal glucose well. Rapid-acting insulin enables patients to have improved glycemic control and diminishes possibilities of long-term complications. With "

Kinetic’s 2025 Digital Safety & Privacy Report revealed less than a quarter (22%) of consumers feel confident their digital security measures are effective in protecting their data and privacy, yet three quarters (77%) of consumers are concerned with their security while online and two out of three (67%) are more cautious today with their personal data. Additionally, very few consumers are taking common security steps, as only a third (37%) of respondents update their passwords every few months, while only a quarter (27%) read privacy policy updates. This data collectively indicates fatigue and distress among consumers when it comes to digital security and a desire for effortless protection without the burden of vigilance and manual effort. ​ Kinetic’s report found consumers shy away from taking a more proactive approach to digital security due to a lack of technical knowledge (37%), cost of tools (32%), and not knowing where to start (28%), further highlighting the need for set-it-and-forget-it solutions to protect consumers.

This grant will allow STRIVE’s Future Leaders program to deepen its impact for individuals aged 18-24 who either have been involved themselves or have family members who have been involved in the juvenile or adult justice systems, or those who left school before graduation due to systemic or personal challenges. The funding will allow STRIVE to continue its programs in New York City, and New Orleans through its affiliate, Café Reconcile, while launching a new Future Leaders program in Birmingham. The goal is to serve 450 young adults age 18–24 over this two-year grant period. “STRIVE’s long-standing partnership with the Department of Labor reflects its proven track record of success,” said Philip Weinberg, STRIVE president and CEO. “Our supporters, including the DOL, recognize that STRIVE is a strategic investment. We’re grateful for the ongoing support that allows us to expand our reach and increase our impact.” A Proven Pathway to Economic Mobility Future Leaders is an evidence-based initiative that equips students with the skills, support and confidence needed to pursue long-term career success. While the new DOL funding specifically targets young adults who are justice-impacted, STRIVE plans to eventually broaden the program to reach more young adults with a variety of experiences as it expands into new communities moving forward. Many of the individuals living in the three communities identified by STRIVE for this program are coping with the struggle of living below the poverty line due to limited resources and opportunities.

The announcement follows recent news of Miracle Pay's ongoing discussions to integrate payment services at Romania's planned international airport near Bucharest. Participants can purchase MIRX tokens at $2 each to receive a virtual boarding pass and unique entry number. A scrambled QR code on the presale site gradually reveals itself over time, eventually unveiling the single winning entry. The winner receives two business-class tickets to any destination worldwide. Beyond Airports: Music, Sport, and Mexico 2026 MetaTerra confirmed that future campaign editions will expand into live music and major sporting events, including Mexico 2026. The model remains the same across all editions: participants use their wallets to access experiences ranging from international flights to concert venues and sporting arenas. “ We built Miracle Pay to work in the places people actually go to, like airports, shops, concert venues ,\" said Douglas Anderson, Chairman at MetaTerra Holdings . \" This campaign reflects that same thinking. Crypto doesn't need to be abstract. Your wallet should be your ticket, your access, your stake in things you care about. From airports to stadiums worldwide, we're showing that utility isn't a future promise. It's a working passport .\" New Approach to Crypto Community Engagement The campaign runs on miraclechain.net and offers a live case study in how blockchain projects can talk to people without the usual jargon. Instead of whitepapers and vague roadmaps, participants get a clear exchange: purchase MIRX, receive a boarding pass, watch the QR code unlock, and compete for a tangible reward. Each MIRX purchase feeds into the platform's dual-token structure, where MIRX unlocks staking rewards, revenue-sharing, and early a"

Enhanced Oil Recovery Market is expected to reach US$ 68.38 billion by 2033 from US$ 47.64 billion in 2024, with a CAGR of 3.04% from 2025 to 2033 Some of the key reasons driving the market include the growing number of aged wells, the decreasing oil production from existing oilfields, the ongoing development of innovative EOR techniques, and the growing desire for enhanced oil production. With its large-scale projects and cutting-edge technologies, North America dominates the EOR industry, although Asia-Pacific and the Middle East have significant development potential because of mature resources, growing energy demand, and encouraging government policies. A collection of cutting-edge procedures used in the oil and gas sector to extract more hydrocarbons from reservoirs than can be recovered with traditional approaches is known as enhanced oil recovery, or EOR. EOR techniques modify reservoir conditions and fluid behavior in an effort to optimize production. Thermal, chemical, and miscible gas injection are common EOR techniques. By raising the reservoir temperature, thermal techniques like steam injection lower oil viscosity and facilitate flow. In order to alter fluid characteristics and facilitate oil displacement, chemical approaches entail infusing polymers or surfactants. Injecting a miscible gas, usually carbon dioxide or nitrogen, improves oil mobility and lowers reservoir resistance. EOR methods are extremely technical and site-specific, taking into account variables including fluid composition, reservoir characteristics, and viability from an economic standpoint. The growing demand for higher oil production is driving the global market. Global demand for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) solutions has increased due to the growing number of ag"

(NYSE: BAX): Grabar Law Office is investigating claims on behalf of shareholders of Baxter International Inc. (NYSE: BAX). The investigation concerns whether certain officers and directors breached the fiduciary duties they owed to the company. If you purchased Baxter International Inc. (NYSE: BAX) shares prior to February 23, 2022, and still hold shares today, you can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever.

A recently filed securities fraud class action complaint alleges that Baxter International Inc. (NYSE: BAX), through certain of its officers and directors, made material misrepresentations to investors by portraying its Novum LVP as safe, while concealing systemic issues that put patients at risk of severe injury and death. Prior to launching the Novum LVP in the United States, Defendants assured investors that Baxter “[was] able to address all of [the] issues” that came up with the initial rollout in Canada, and that the U.S. launch would not be subject to the same issues. While the Novum LVP was rolling out in the United States, Defendant Jose Almeida, Baxter’s former Chief Executive Officer, further assured investors that the launch was “going extremely well” and “one of the best launches that [he’s] seen in [his] career.” In reality, the launch was on the brink of failure due to recurring life-threatening defects in the devices that Baxter could not adequately correct. Specifically, safety concerns regarding Novum LVP began to surface on April 7, 2025 when a Missouri news outlet reported serious safety issues "

    "content": "Toronto, ON, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Canadian Vaping Association urges provincial and federal health ministers to focus on youth prevention and education programs that provide a pathway for youth to quit vaping and smoking. \"It is deeply concerning witnessing certain nicotine control groups and Alberta students lobbying the government for prohibitionist policies rather than offering solutions to address youth vaping.  Rather than reducing harm, restrictive policies of this nature have consistently fuelled the growth of an illicit market, which operates without regulation and often with more dangerous, high-strength products,” says Sam Tam, President of the Canadian Vaping Association, “removing regulated harm reduction options leaves adult smokers with nowhere to turn except back to tobacco use, which kills 1 in every 2 users, and is the leading cause of preventable death in Canada.  This move would undo decades of progress made by the federal government in reducing smoking rates and jeopardizes Canada’s goal of achieving less than 5% tobacco use by 2035.” Yo uth V aping I s D eclini ng The recent claim from a nicotine control group that states “over 300,000 youth under 18 use nicotine products every 30 days” misrepresents national data. According to Statistics Canada’s 2025 Canadian Health Survey on Children and Youth , past-30-day vaping among Canadians aged 12–17 fell to 7.2% a nearly 50% reducti on from the 13.2% peak in 2019 (Statistics Canada, 2025). This decline was also acknowledged in Health Canada’s Third Legislative Review of the Tobacco and Vaping Products Act Discussion Paper (Health Canada, 2025). Canada’s youth vaping rate decline proves that education, not prohibition, is the most effective way to reduce youth vaping rates. The CVA fully supports Health Canada’s initiatives on youth vaping prevention and education, including the “I Quit for Me” Program and other cessations and educational resources for youth who want to quit using tob"

The report reflects Rackspace’s commitment to aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and leading the cloud services industry in sustainability practices. In 2025, the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) validated our Greenhouse Gas (GHG) reduction targets demonstrating our measurable environmental progress aligned with SDG 13. “At Rackspace Technology we are making sustainability a measurable part of how we run the company,” said, Gajen Kandiah, Chief Executive Officer, Rackspace Technology. “In 2025 our near-term and long-term targets were validated by the SBTi, we reduced total emissions by 10 percent from our 2023 baseline, and we improved efficiency at priority sites. The same discipline now shows up in how we help customers lower costs and carbon. We will continue to report with clear data, independent reviews, and strong governance.” Rackspace’s sustainability efforts emphasize renewable energy, conservation and advocacy. Approximately 28.4 percent of electricity used across Rackspace operated data centers in 2024 was matched on a market basis through Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and/or Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs). We plan to increase long-term contracting as markets allow. In 2025, SBTi validated our near-term targets for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, and for Scope 3 purchased goods and services, using a 2023 baseline. Our long-term net zero target covers Scopes 1, 2, and 3 with neutralization of residual emissions by 2045. Here are more examples of the organization’s outcomes: Progress 10% total emissions reduction in one year: achieved from 2023 to 2024, including a 20"

This version includes major updates to U.S. ecosystem types and aligns the classification with global standards, providing critical support for natural resources management and biodiversity conservation. The USNVC is an ecologically grounded framework for classifying the nation’s terrestrial vegetation in an eight-level hierarchy from global biomes to local plant communities. Built on the international EcoVeg Approach, the classification shares the same structure as the Canadian National Vegetation Classification (CNVC) and NatureServe’s International Vegetation Classification and is also aligned with the Global Ecosystem Typology, ensuring that U.S. ecosystem data can be integrated seamlessly into international assessments. “This publication represents the sustained and coordinated effort of state, federal, academic, and conservation ecologists working together to deliver an authoritative and comprehensive synopsis of the nation’s terrestrial ecosystems,” said Don Faber-Langendoen, Senior Ecologist & Conservation Methods Coordinator at NatureServe and Editor-in-Chief of the USNVC. What’s New in Version 3.0 Version 3.0 is the first major update since 2016 and includes: A global scientific foundation: The upper levels have been restructured using well-understood biome concepts, aligning the U.S. system with the IUCN’s Global Ecosystem Typology.

Built on proprietary healthcare-specific natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs), the RADV platform automates chart review, evidence validation, and Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) coding reconciliation, enabling payers to identify, document, and defend risk-adjusted conditions with unprecedented accuracy. “RADV audits are no longer retrospective events, but a year-round operational priority,” said Ritwik Jain, Co-Founder and CRO, Martlet.ai. “With CMS expanding its audit scope and applying extrapolation across populations, health plans need proactive systems that ensure data integrity, clinical defensibility, and compliance at scale, and our platform delivers exactly that.” The Martlet.ai RADV Audit Readiness Platform integrates directly into clients’ environments and workflows, ensuring full HIPAA compliance and data governance. By combining chart-level NLP insights with evidence-based scoring, the system produces auditable summaries for each HCC, highlighting potential gaps before CMS auditors do. “We designed this platform to mirror the precision and transparency auditors expect, but with the speed and scalability only AI can provide,” said Hasham Ul Haq, Co-Founder and CTO, Martlet.ai. “Because it runs entirely within the client’s environment, our solution can be fine-tuned to their documentation style, data structure, and population health profile, enhancing accuracy without sacrificing security.” The launch of the RADV Audit Readiness Platform follows a broader mission to modernize risk adjustment, coding, and help payers and providers bring these capabilities in"

    "content": "COLUMBUS, Ohio, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A new functional supplement called Hunger Switch™, created by Oakmont Nutrition, is drawing attention for using a naturally derived yeast peptide to help people manage appetite and calorie intake—without drugs or stimulants. The formulation centers on DNF-10® , a clinically studied hydrolyzed yeast peptide shown to influence the gut–brain axis involved in hunger regulation. Researchers have found that participants using DNF-10® consumed significantly fewer calories per day, suggesting a potential new approach to appetite control through nutritional pathways rather than pharmacological ones. By targeting the same biological communication loop that connects the digestive system and the brain’s satiety centers, Hunger Switch™ aims to support a more balanced relationship with food. The supplement pairs DNF-10® with complementary compounds including L-theanine, caffeine , and inulin —ingredients chosen to promote steady energy, reduce cravings, and support digestive health. The product’s launch reflects a broader movement within the wellness industry toward natural solutions that mimic the body’s existing metabolic cues. As interest in GLP-1-based appetite therapies continues to rise, researchers and formulators are exploring nutritional compounds that can activate similar mechanisms through diet and supplementation. Each batch of Hunger Switch™ is manufactured in the United States under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and undergoes independent laboratory verification for purity and potency. The gummies are vegan-friendly and free from artificial dyes or preservatives. Industry observers note that the growing focus on gut–brain science is shaping the next generation of weight-management and wellness products—offering consumers options that emphasize balance, sustainability, and accessible daily use. DNF-10® is marketed by Fytexia. About Oakmont Nutrition Oakmont Nutrition, a division of Vantiso Brands LLC, d"

Keycard provides the guardrails that allow agents to act safely on behalf of people and businesses, unlocking the true potential of the agent economy,” said Ian Livingstone, co-founder and CEO of Keycard. Keycard was co-founded by Ian Livingstone, Matthew Creager and Jared Hanson. Livingstone and Creager served as senior leaders at Snyk where they built the platform engineering and developer experience divisions as revenues grew from $30 million to $300 million. Hanson was the Chief Architect at Auth0 before joining Okta as a senior technical leader, and he created Passport.js, the most popular authentication framework for Node.js that is downloaded millions of times every week. At these companies, the trio witnessed how developers constantly struggled to connect services and applications together within and across organizations at enterprise scale - often leading to painful security incidents and significant product delays. This problem has only been exacerbated with AI agents. Today they spawn by the thousands and operate autonomously across systems and organizational boundaries. They need different permissions based on the task they are working on, which people and companies they are doing the task for, the resources they are accessing and who owns those resources.

The funding is in support of an innovative program aimed at equipping older adult small business owners and entrepreneurs with the technology skills they need to succeed in today’s digital age. This new initiative will provide hands-on training and resources designed to help older adults utilize technology to enhance their businesses.

Together, we will create more financial security for older adults and their families, while building a model for replication in communities across the country.” In its first year, OATS will launch the program at its recently opened Senior Planet center in Miami’s Wynwood neighborhood, with plans to expand to a total of 10 partner sites across Miami in the second year. The program will also be available virtually, providing access for participants across the country. During the two-year grant period, OATS will serve older adult small business owners through workshops, lectures, and digital resources. “Small businesses are the backbone of the U.S. economy.

This collaboration brings together three ecosystem leaders with a shared vision: delivering yield opportunities that balance performance, transparency, and risk management. Chorus One Earn is designed to meet the treasury management needs of institutional investors, DAOs, and DeFi or fintech platforms seeking tailored exposure to stablecoin yields with varying risk profiles. A New Standard for Risk-Managed Stablecoin Yield Through collaborations with universal lending networks like Morpho and curated strategies from Steakhouse, Chorus One Earn introduces a streamlined, non-custodial earning experience for stablecoin holders. The platform’s architecture enables users to: Earn yield directly through the Chorus One Widget, dApp, or SDK; Seamlessly deposit and withdraw USDC through the Chorus One interface; Access curated vaults with active liquidity management and automated risk controls; Retrieve real-time rewards data via the Chorus One Rewards platform. This approach gives institutions and on-chain treasuries confidence in managing idle assets efficiently, while maintaining transparency into performance and risk parameters. Curated Vaults: Tailored Risk and Return Profiles At launch, Chorus One Earn will feature two curated vaults – Steakhouse Prime and High Yield USDC – each allocating deposited USDC into carefully underwritten Morpho markets. The vaults generate yield from borrower interest, net of fees, and are rebalanced periodically by their curators to maintain targeted risk/return characteristics.

(Nasdaq: NXL) (the “Company” or “Nexalin”), the leader in Deep Intracranial Frequency Stimulation (DIFS™) of the brain, today announced that three independently published, peer-reviewed clinical studies, coupled with a growing body of internal data, collectively demonstrate the ability of its proprietary 15 milliamp (mA) Gen-2 Nexalin DIFS™ technology—to improve cognition, restore brain activity, and enhance neuron connectivity in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Each study was announced separately upon publication. Taken together, the results provide a convergent body of evidence validating Nexalin’s differentiated, non-invasive approach to treating Alzheimer’s disease. 1. TRANSFORM-AD – Alzheimer’s Research & Therapy This randomized, double-blind clinical trial (46 patients) evaluated 30 one-hour DIFS sessions over 15 days. Patients receiving active stimulation demonstrated immediate improvements in MMSE and MoCA scores, alongside enhanced hippocampal theta-gamma coupling and increased low-frequency fluctuations on fMRI. The study provided the first rigorous evidence of hippocampal activation and short-term cognitive benefit from DIFS in Alzheimer’s and Dementia. 2. Altered Neuronal Activity – Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease A subsequent publication used resting-state fMRI to analyze brain network changes. Results demonstrated significant increases in fALFF and regional homogeneity (ReHo) in key prefrontal and memory-related regions, including the left middle frontal gyrus and right parahippocampal gyrus. These findings underscored DIFS’ ability to restore regional neuronal synchronization and blood flow in disrupted networks. 3. Modulation of Cortical and Hippocampal Connectivity – Radiology The most recent publication, appearing in Radiology (June 2025), showed that DIFS significantly improved cognition while enhancing connectivity between the hippocampus and cortical regions, includ"

    "content": "DALLAS, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Janta Power, a leading developer of innovative three-dimensional solar tower systems, has closed a $5.5 million seed round led by MaC Venture Capital , with participation from Collab Capital , to accelerate the commercialization of its patented, high-density 3D photovoltaic tower technology. This investment will support product scale-up and deployments across data centers, EV charging hubs, telecom towers, universities, and a range of industrial facilities. Janta’s vertical solar towers are engineered to generate ~50% more energy than traditional flat-panel systems while using one-third of the land area, overcoming energy-density and siting constraints that limit conventional solar. Pilot programs are underway with major global airports, including Munich International Airport , Aena (operator of over 70 airports worldwide), and Dallas–Fort Worth International Airport (DFW), as part of the Airports for Innovation (A4I) initiative. Janta’s patented tower geometry achieves approximately three times the solar surface area exposure of traditional flat arrays within the same land footprint. Each tower’s stacked vertical design captures both low-angle morning and evening light, producing a dual-peak power curve that better aligns with real energy demand. Typical installations achieve a capacity factor of ~32%, compared to ~22% for flat panels, thanks to active shading optimization and control software. Each structure is engineered to withstand winds of up to 140 mph, featuring steel construction and modular helical or pier foundations that eliminate the need for heavy grading.

The loans, with a balance of approximately $438 million, are currently serviced by Select Portfolio Servicing Inc., NewRez LLC, d/b/a Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, Selene Finance LP, and Nationstar Mortgage LLC, d/b/a Rushmore Servicing. The transaction is expected to settle in December 2025. The sale is part of Freddie Mac’s Standard Pool Offerings (SPO ® ). Freddie Mac, through its advisors, began marketing the transaction on September 25, 2025, to potential bidders active in the NPL market. Bids for the upcoming Extended Timeline Pool Offering (EXPO ® ), which is a smaller sized pool of loans, are due from qualified bidders by October 30, 2025. The loans in the SPO ® offerings were offered as four pools of mortgage loans. The pools consist of mortgage loans secured by geographically diverse properties. Given the delinquency status of the loans, the borrowers have likely been evaluated previously for loss mitigation, including modification or other alternatives to foreclosure, or are in foreclosure. Mortgages that were previously modified and subsequently became delinquent comprise approximately 55 percent of the aggregate pool balance. Additionally, purchasers are required to honor the terms of existing loss mitigation agreements and solicit distressed borrowers for additional assistance except in limited cases and ensure all pending loss mitigation actions are completed. The SPO pools and winning bidders are summarized below: Description Pool #1 Pool #2 Pool #3 Pool #4 Unpaid Principal Balance $ 229.4 million $ 117.0 million $ 67.3 million $ 24.7 million Loan Count 1202 602 293 104 BPO-weighted* CLTV (in %) 45 46 63 57 UPB-weighted CLTV (in %) 55 56 69 64 Average Months Delinquent 20 19 31 19 Average Loan Balance (in $000s) 190.8 "

The Birth to Five Leadership Academy (B5LA) was launched this fall to support Maryland’s special education school district leaders and leaders in Maryland’s Infants & Toddlers Program and Preschool Special Education. These academies build on a partnership that began in 2024, with a year-long Directors’ Leadership Academy for all Directors of Special Education and Maryland State Department of Education’s senior leaders in special education. “This year, we’re proud to grow a vibrant learning community where leadership, mentorship, and equity intersect,” said Dr. Antoine L. Hickman, Assistant State Superintendent, Division of Special Education. “By investing in effective mentoring, we’re building capacity, strengthening resilience, and preparing the next generation of leaders to navigate complexity with clarity and compassion.” Over the past year, PCG facilitated targeted professional development for DALA participants, creating a collaborative space to address district-level challenges and share innovative practices. The inaugural cohort celebrated its graduation in June in Annapolis. “As a member of the first cohort, I worked closely with PCG to analyze district needs and implement proactive solutions to address disproportionality,” said Kevin Smith, Director of Special Education and Early Intervention Services, Wicomico County. “This experience deepened our district’s commitment to compassionate leadership, collaboration, and clear communication.” The B5LA will offer a year-long blend of virtual and in-person professional learning, equipping early childhood leaders with evidence-based strategies and fostering cross-agency collaboration"

BOSTON, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dewpoint Therapeutics today announced the opening of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for DPTX3186, a first-in-class, only-in-class oral condensate modulator (c-mod) designed to selectively disrupt oncogenic Wnt/β-catenin signaling in tumors. Dewpoint plans to begin dosing its first patient before the end of 2025 in a combined Phase 1/2 trial conducted in partnership with leading cancer centers and key opinion leaders in gastric and other Wnt-driven cancers. The IND opening marks a significant milestone in Dewpoint’s journey and underscores the strength of its partnership with Evotec, a global drug discovery and development company. Evotec leveraged its deep expertise in drug development to provide integrated support across preclinical, regulatory, and CMC, helping to translate a de novo candidate emerging from Dewpoint’s proprietary c-mod platform into a robust and clinically ready investigational therapy. “Evotec’s depth of experience and proven track record in advancing first-in-class small molecules through their Evotec INDiGO ® platform made them an ideal partner for this effort,” said Ameet Nathwani, Chief Executive Officer of Dewpoint Therapeutics. “Their scientific rigor and development agility were instrumental in helping us take a novel condensate-derived mechanism from concept to IND.

Representing over 300,000 people in the U.S. living with neuromuscular diseases — and millions of family members, MDA’s delegation will focus on three urgent priorities that directly affect quality of life and long-term health outcomes: Protect NIH research funding , which has historically driven the discovery of life-changing therapies and cures. Cosponsor the ABC Act (Alleviating Barriers for Caregivers) , which aims to simplify administrative processes for family caregivers. Reauthorize Enhanced ACA Premium Tax Credits , ensuring affordable healthcare coverage for people, including those with chronic and progressive conditions such as neuromuscular disease. “For 75 years, the Muscular Dystrophy Association has driven progress for more than 300 neuromuscular diseases — but that progress depends on strong public policy,” said Mark Fisher, Director, Advocacy Engagement, MDA . “Protecting NIH research funding ensures that breakthroughs continue. Easing the burdens for caregivers through the ABC Act recognizes the essential role of families in care. And reauthorizing Enhanced Affordable Care Act Premium Tax Credits keeps vital treatments within reach. Every moment matters in the fight against muscle loss. Time is muscle, and we can’t afford to wait.” “Time is everything for families living with neuromuscular disease,” said Sharon Hesterlee, PhD, interim President and CEO of the Muscular Dystrophy Association . “Every advance in research, every policy that expands access to care, and every effort that strengthens support for caregivers adds time.

    "content": "Induced Polarization Testing Successfully Maps Gold-Bearing Veins with High Precision TUCSON, AZ, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Liberty Star Minerals (\"Liberty Star\" or the \"Company\") (OTCQB: LBSR) is pleased to announce the successful completion of induced polarization (IP) and resistivity testing over known gold-bearing veins at its wholly owned Red Rock Canyon Gold Project within the Hay Mountain Project in southeast Arizona. Key Highlights from IP Test Survey The geophysical test performed in July 2025 has proven highly successful in detecting and characterizing gold-bearing veins. The three major takeaways from the IP test demonstrate: Gold-bearing veins are readily detected, easily mapped, and can be characterized with electrical geophysics. The gold-bearing veins exhibit higher resistivity than the hosting limestone due to their siliceous, jasperoidal character, making them detectable using simple resistivity even where soil cover has rendered them invisible. Additionally, the gold-bearing veins display higher IP values than the hosting limestone, confirming their association with sulfide mineralization including pyrite and arsenopyrite, characteristic of Carlin-style deposits. Enhanced Exploration Capabilities The close-spaced data intervals of 3 meters (10 feet) allow precise quantification of vein thickness, strike and rough dip, significantly enhancing pre-drilling grade estimation. The association of IP with detectable sulfides enables selective grading of anomalous veins by their amplitude of IP response, which will prove invaluable in siting drillholes. Volumetric estimates of gold content may be achievable with grid-style surveys, and the confirmation of the relationship between IP and gold-bearing veins raises the importance of older IP anomalies that may warrant detailed surveys. The full report will be available soon on the Liberty Star website. Management Commentary \"We are pleased and excited to report that this geophysical test has exceede"

The partnership elevates investment in brand safety and compliance auditing across influencer and creator marketing campaigns. It reflects what the market demands, bringing together New Engen’s expertise in creator-led campaigns with DoDilly’s technology for monitoring FTC disclosures, brand guardrails, and contractual requirements. “Working with New Engen makes brand safety seamless. Their team brings the expertise, tools, and behind-the-scenes monitoring needed to safeguard campaigns from compliance risks, FTC violations, and contract breaches,” said Lindsey Campbell, Omnichannel Marketing Advisor, CPG & Automotive, and New Engen client. “That means we can move faster, stay focused on creative impact, and scale our creator programs with true confidence.” Rising Challenge of Creator Compliance As influencer and creator marketing investments grow, brands face mounting risks from FTC non-disclosure violations, competitor exclusivity breaches, and brand safety missteps. Many creators and brands lack awareness of compliance standards, putting them at risk of fines or reputational harm. Manual monitoring at scale is time-consuming and often impractical. A Tech-Enabled Solution DoDilly’s platform reviews creator content across images, video, stories, comments, tags, and audio for FTC compliance, brand safety, and contractual requirements. By integrating these audits directly into creator-led campaigns, New Engen provides clients stronger guarantees of safety and compliance without slowing execution. Over just a few months, DoDilly supported a high volume of campaigns for New Engen and its clients, monitoring thousands"

    "content": "REDWOOD CITY, Calif., Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As momentum for direct-to-consumer (DTC) drug sales grows, a new survey from Model N, the leader in revenue optimization and compliance for life sciences and high-tech companies, reveals that 72% of consumers would be somewhat or very likely to use this type of service. Through this channel, patients can buy prescriptions directly from pharmaceutical manufacturers at a discount, bypassing traditional pharmacy and insurance channels. The interest in DTC drug sales is underscored by ongoing affordability challenges – 40% of surveyed respondents reported skipping or delaying prescription fills due to financial concerns. Price is the top factor influencing DTC purchases; nearly three-quarters said lower costs would make them more likely to purchase medication directly from a manufacturer. The level of interest in DTC was comparable across all income brackets. However, only 22% of those surveyed have used a DTC service. Pharmaceutical companies are investing more heavily in this channel. In fact, some companies have recently announced agreements to participate in government-run DTC portals, as well as initiatives developed by the Pharmaceuticals Manufacturers Association. “The direct-to-consumer channel is a promising step forward in how life sciences companies can expand patient access to medication,” said Bret Connor, Model N’s Chief Executive Officer. “At Model N, we empower the world’s leading manufacturers with innovative pricing, compliance, and revenue optimization solutions that support their efforts in bringing life-changing solutions to more people.” Barriers to DTC adoption Despite the willingness of consumers to use DTC services, 86% of consumers did express concerns about purchasing directly from pharmaceutical manufacturers. Considerations include: Problems with insurance covering the cost: 58% Delivery reliability: 38% How they check if a prescription is valid: 37% Lack of pharmacist consultation: 3"

New Leadership Addition: ONAR appointed marketing leader Troy Osinoff as Chief Growth Officer to lead company-wide growth initiatives and integration across the agency network. Accretive M&A continues: The company recently signed a binding letter of intent to acquire a New York-based performance marketing agency expected to add more than seven figures of recurring annual revenue once the transaction closes. The target name will remain confidential until the deal is finalized. AI technology expansion: Following the completed acquisition of Retina AI, ONAR has begun aligning Retina’s data and AI technology with JUICE’s performance marketing platform to create additional value and cross-sell opportunities across the portfolio. “These past few weeks have shown clear progress,” said Claude Zdanow, CEO of ONAR. “JUICE is already winning new business, expanding existing accounts, and integrating effectively with Storia.

This development is aimed at protecting the integrity of the capital structure while preserving strategic flexibility for growth and acquisitions moving forward. In addition, the company is providing an outline of the next steps. Once the issued and outstanding share count is formally updated in the next 10 days and following the removal of the temporary “D” designation from the stock, the PTOP will align its authorized share count to an approximate 5:1 ratio, authorized to issued and outstanding shares respectively. Management, Josh Sodaitis and Derek McCarthy, are committed to a disciplined cap-table framework that scales only with acquisitions and revenue generating, value add needs. “The goal is simple: do what’s right for our investors,” said Josh Sodaitis, CEO of Peer-to-Peer Network. Why This Matters Dilution mitigation: A reduction of approximately 95% underscores a commitment to protecting shareholder equity and maintaining a high-integrity capitalization structure. Reserved flexibility: Remaining authorized shares will be allocated prudently to strategic initiatives such as future acquisitions, partnerships, cloud processing, AI development, MobiCard™, initiatives, and new product launch expenses, and not routine operations. Focused capital strategy: For the next six months, the company anticipates minimal operational capital needs and expects to limit financing activity, offering subscription agreements only through November 15th. Positioned for 2026: Entering the new year, Peer-to-Peer Network expects to drive meaningful revenue growth supported by the launch of Intelligence labs AI solutions for public companies and small businesses.

    "content": "PALO ALTO, Calif., Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rising wage inflation and an AI talent crunch are ending the era of domestic-first hiring, forcing companies to go global faster than ever. A new global survey from Pebl finds that 86% of HR and finance leaders plan to expand hiring abroad within two years, and nearly half (48%) expect international workers to make up 50% or more of their workforce by 2027. And for good reason - 87% of leaders agree that hiring abroad makes sound economic sense. “The era of domestic-first hiring is over,” said Francoise Brougher, CEO at Pebl. “Companies that don’t build borderless teams will fall behind. It's as simple as that. Wage inflation, AI skill scarcity, and regulatory complexity – from rising H1–B visa costs to compliance hurdles – are all making it difficult for companies to hit their growth goals. The smart ones are looking for talent worldwide, and we can help.” From the U.S. to Europe, hiring is now global by default Global hiring is no longer gradual; it’s accelerating. Leaders forecast a 57% jump in international hiring in the next year, rising to 69% within 24 months. Nearly half say they are ramping up global hiring by early 2026, with the U.S. moving most aggressively (46%), ahead of Germany (43%) and the U.K. (38%). The U.K., however, is doubling down. Leaders there expect to more than double global hiring, from 38% at six months to 85% at 24 months. By 2028, 40% of all executives predict the most successful companies will “hire globally by default,” leaving country-first models behind. Inflation Is the New Jobs Exporter Wage shock at home is sending jobs abroad at record speed. In the U.S., 61% say wage inflation is pushing them toward distributed models, 60% are leaning on automation and AI to offset costs, and 57% are speeding up overseas hiring. Immigration delays add to the push: 28% of U.S. leaders cite visa bottlenecks as a driver of hiring abroad, compared with 18% in the U.K. and Germany. In addition,"

The data also reveals that healthcare organizations have adopted AI 2.2x faster than the broader economy. “For years, AI in healthcare felt like a promise waiting for proof,” said Greg Yap, Partner at Menlo Ventures. “Now we’re seeing evidence at scale that AI tools can actually fit into clinical workflows, make work easier, and improve outcomes. Our research shows that the healthcare industry is reaching an inflection point in AI adoption.” According to the report, 22% of healthcare organizations have deployed domain-specific AI solutions, up 7x from 2024. Health systems lead with 27% adoption, followed by outpatient providers ( 18% ) and payers ( 14% ). Additionally, the industry now counts eight AI unicorns across medical documentation, revenue cycle management (RCM), and payer operations, surpassing every other vertical AI category. Key Findings: The Pilot Phase Is Over (For Many): Of the $1.4 billion now flowing into healthcare AI, the vast majority is in production, not pilots. Providers account for $1 billion ( 75% ) of that spend. The biggest categories are ambient clinical documentation ( $600M ) and coding and billing automation ( $450M ); the fastest growing are patient engagement ( +20x YoY ) and prior authorization ( +10x YoY ). Providers Accelerate, Payers Proceed with Caution: Buying cycles for AI tools are 18% shorter for health systems and 22% shorter for outpatient providers as they race to capture operational gains. Buying cycles for payers are 20% slower as they remain largely in piloting and experimentation mode. Startups Capture Vast Majority of AI Spend, but Incumbents are Striking Back: Startups currently dominate, captur"

    "content": "SAN FRANCISCO, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Samba TV, the global leader in AI-driven media intelligence, today announced a partnership with Aquila, a subsidiary of the Association of National Advertisers (ANA), to advance streaming video measurement within Aquila’s cross-media platform initiative. This partnership is a pivotal step toward building the industry's first advertiser-owned, independent measurement solution capable of deduplicating reach and frequency across streaming services, linear television, and major digital walled gardens. By integrating Samba TV’s rich first-party streaming viewership data into Aquila’s privacy-safe, marketer-led framework, the partnership will give advertisers an independent, objective view of their true audience reach across all major digital and television platforms, solving a long-standing challenge of audience fragmentation. For years, streaming TV has been a significant blind spot in cross-media measurement. Streaming viewership has grown 46% year-over-year, bolstered by ad-supported tiers at lower prices, making streaming an essential component of every modern media strategy. This partnership bridges that gap by integrating Samba TV’s unparalleled first-party streaming viewership data into Aquila’s platform, complementing existing data from Google, Meta, TikTok, and Amazon, as well as linear data from Comscore. “We are thrilled to join our friends at Aquila, which include some of the largest advertisers and media platforms, to crack the code of cross-platform measurement,” said Samba TV CEO and Co-founder Ashwin Navin. “Advertisers can no longer afford to measure media with currencies that treat streaming and digital as an afterthought to linear TV in their methodology. A cross-media view with a true streaming signal and collaboration with the biggest digital platforms in the world is a recipe for success. Samba provides a critical piece of the dataset that unlocks a uniquely holistic view that everyone has been wait"

Highlights: Second diamond drill hole ( COP-002 ) completed to a depth of 121 metres . Enhanced alteration and veining intensity observed relative to COP-001. Intersections include zones of silicification , biotite , quartz veining , sericite-chlorite , and weak carbonate alteration — features commonly associated with hydrothermal gold systems . Geological and structural logging underway; sampling in progress for gold and multi-element analysis. Drill rig mobilized to third pad , 100 metres west along strike from COP-001 and COP-002. Drill hole CP-24-002 was advanced to a total downhole depth of 121 metres, intersecting lithologies consistent with those observed in the nearby first hole (COP-001). Importantly, the second hole displayed notable enhancements in alteration and veining intensity, including broader zones of silicification, localized biotite alteration, and quartz veining accompanied by sericite-chlorite and weak carbonate alteration. These alteration assemblages are often indicative of hydrothermal fluid activity associated with gold mineralizing systems. Detailed geological and structural logging of both COP-001 and COP-002 is currently underway. Sampling for gold and multi-element geochemical analysis will follow immediately after the logging process. All samples will be prepared at ALS Laboratories’ facility in Cuiabá, Mato Grosso, and subsequently analyzed at the ALS analytical laboratory in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais.

On July 22, 2025, Blue Orca Capital (“Blue Orca”) issued a short report on Nutex. The Blue Orca report alleges, among other things, that Nutex faces litigation risk due to its relationship with HaloMD, a third-party vendor that was recently sued for engaging in a “coordinated fraudulent scheme” to take millions from insurance companies on behalf of healthcare billing clients. Following publication of the Blue Orca report, Nutex’s stock price fell $11.18 per share, or 10.05%, to close at $100.01 per share on July 22, 2025.

    "content": "SAN FRANCISCO, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pila Energy , maker of plug-in, mesh home batteries for accessible backup power and lower-friction energy control, today announced it has raised $4 million in seed funding led by R7 Partners, with participation from Toyota Ventures, Refactor Capital, GS Futures, and other strategic backers. The round accelerates Pila’s U.S. launch, and scales manufacturing, priority partnerships, and continued development of Pila’s grid-aware software. With this funding, Pila's batteries are now available to order. Across the U.S., outages are lasting longer and striking more often, leaving millions without power for days at a time. Residential electricity prices are outpacing inflation, and have climbed nearly 30% since 2021 . Meanwhile, utilities are stretched by aging infrastructure, wildfire/storm risks, and growing demand from data centers and new industrial loads. And with 1 in 6 American households behind on energy bills, the need for affordable solutions that scale quickly is immediate. “Growing up in New Orleans, I saw firsthand how devastating large-scale outages can be,” said Cole Ashman, Pila Founder & CEO, and veteran of Tesla’s Powerwall and SPAN’s smart panel. “Reliable power should be the standard, not a luxury. Energy independence at home and a stronger grid aren’t trade-offs, and with Pila, they support each other, and are now available for order for any home or business.” The Pila Battery provides smart, simple, automatic backup power that puts people in control of their power and reinforces the grid: Plug-and-play backup: Set up Pila’s smart batteries in minutes via a standard wall outlet. Each 1.6 kWh unit keeps essentials — fridges, Wi-Fi, window A/Cs, sump pumps, medical devices — running when the grid goes down. Mesh technology for whole-home power management: Pila is the first of its kind mesh battery. Like mesh Wi-Fi, multiple batteries work together through Pila’s Battery Mesh Network — quietly in the back"

Together, the companies are aligning their expertise to transform how clean energy and AI infrastructure are deployed at scale. \"The demand for power in the datacenter sector has never been greater,\" said Prabhdeep Sekhon, CEO of Eclipse Energy. \"By bringing our innovative subsurface solutions into partnership with Armada, we are addressing both the urgent need for clean, reliable power and the imperative to build with sustainability in mind.\" Armada has established itself as a disruptive force for edge computing, achieving rapid success in deploying next-generation, full-stack infrastructure to meet surging digital demand. The company is scaling quickly, with a trajectory to become the hyperscaler for the edge and redefine how these computing powerhouses are built, powered, and maintained across the globe. “Eclipse Energy’s bioconversion of legacy oil fields into clean hydrogen is a natural complement to Armada’s Galleon Modular Data Centers,” said Dan Wright, CEO and Co-Founder of Armada. “By pairing their subsurface hydrogen production with our modular compute assets, we can deliver truly off-grid, carbon-aware data centers and prove that scalable performance and sustainable energy can go hand in hand.” Eclipse Energy combines geoscience, engineering, and deep microbiology to redefine the subsurface as a clean energy asset. Recent accomplishments like the successful completion of the world’s first field trial demonstrating subsurface bio-stimulated hydrogen production established a roadmap to produce this low-cost, low-carbon energy using existing infrastructure.

    "content": "Dublin, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Functional Foods Market by Product Type, Ingredient, Distribution Channel, Application, Countries and Companies Analysis 2025-2033\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The Global Functional Foods Market will grow at a CAGR of 7.92% from 2025 to 2033 and reach US$ 678.32 billion by 2033, from US$ 341.6 billion in 2024. The growth is fueled by increasing health awareness among consumers, rising demand for fortified foods, and global emphasis on preventive healthcare through diet-based solutions in developed and emerging nations. Worldwide, demand for functional foods is expanding incredibly fast because people are becoming more conscious about the relationship between diet and well-being. Established economies of the world such as the United States, Japan, and Germany have organized markets, whereas developing nations such as India, Brazil, and China are experiencing surging demand. Aging populations, lifestyle diseases, and changes in healthcare towards preventive care continue to drive the usage of functional foods by all segments of the population in the world. Growth Drivers in the Global Functional Foods Industry Growing Health Awareness Among Buyers The rising incidence of lifestyle disorders like obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases has created increased awareness among consumers about the need for proper nutrition and preventive healthcare. Consumers are now widely preferring functional foods with added vitamins, probiotics, and other health-enhancing ingredients to support overall wellness. This change in consumer habits is a central force for the market, particularly among city dwellers. In the most recent YouGov/AHDB Pulse survey, 90% of shoppers reported diet was important and 86% reported fitness was important, in relation to their general health (December 2024). Among this group, 48% exercise three or more times a week regularly and 64% asserted that they always or often h"

(CBOE: VERS) (OTCQB: VRSSF) (“VERSES” or the “Company”), a cognitive computing company specializing in next-generation agentic software systems, is pleased to announce that the Company has been recognized in the 2025 Gartner Emerging Tech Impact Radar: Spatial AI as a sample vendor for the World Models and Spatial Computing use cases. This report states that “Spatial AI is turbocharging AI’s value by fusing 3D context with physics—powered by breakthrough solutions across physical AI, reality capture, and spatial development frameworks” and that: “By 2035, every autonomous system, from industrial to drones to wearables, will incorporate a standardized Spatial AI layer, up from less than 1% in 2025.” “By 2028, five of the top 10 AI companies will strategically pivot to specialized physical AI solutions, leaving digital-only competitors out of the AI race.” Among the 11 topics examined in the report related to Spatial AI are Spatial Web Systems and Spatial Web Protocols. Gartner describes the Spatial Web as “a fundamental shift that will monetize physical reality by creating a World Wide Web for the real world, transforming interactions with assets, people, and places,” but notes that, “without the proper tools (spatial development frameworks), it will be impossible to reap the business benefits of a cohesive spatial AI ecosystem.” As Gartner explains, “The IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) approved the first standards for Spatial Web protocol, architecture, and governance in May 2025. Future Spatial Web systems will be based on these and subsequent standards...These build upon and extend the foundations of the current World Wide Web.” VERSES participated in the IEEE Spatial Web Working Group alongside the Spatial Web Foundation and intends to implement Spatial AI by supporting the HSML and HSTP standards in its product, Genius TM .

    "content": "WAUCHULA, Fla., Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BASports.com was #1 in the USA in the Las Vegas Handicapper of the Year Contest run by SWM. They also won the last NBA Basketball Contest in Las Vegas with more than 3 times the profit of #2. Dr. Bob Akmens, BASports.com’s founder & CEO, says: “Betting on basketball games is very easy. Consistently winning those bets is very hard.” Since 1978, BASports.com has made it easier for their hundreds of thousands of customers to win when they bet on basketball games, winning 80 national Basketball Handicapping Contests. And this NCAA & NBA basketball season is again looking like it’s going to be super profitable for their customers. All the search engines, and all the top experts in the field of sports handicapping, know that BASports.com is at the very top of their profession. They’re the only pro handicappers who’ve ever won the Las Vegas Sports Handicapper of the Year Contest twice. The last time they won in 2022, they had a net profit won figure of +$135,970 which was almost 4 times greater than the runner-up’s +$37,630. And that contest had 200+ others in it. This was the largest winning-margin ever in any Las Vegas sports handicapping contest. Their success can be chalked up to the most powerful predictive computer model, now aided by A.I., that anyone has ever seen. But the unique edge that BASports.com has which insures their #1-rank in winning among all sports handicappers is their massive web of human contacts in college and pro sports, who share with them information that is simply not available to the general public. Imagine if someone knew that the star player in that big NBA TV game coming that night had his wife filing for an ugly divorce earlier that day. But that information wasn’t yet publicly available. Do you think that player’s head would be screwed on straight for that game, that particular night? Do you think a bet on his team would be wise? In no way would that be a good bet. So, combining the best"

As these sectors expand, small-cap companies are increasingly using acquisitions to scale operations, generate measurable revenue and strengthen their technological capabilities. This strategic growth not only positions these companies to compete effectively in a rapidly evolving market but also sets the stage for uplisting from over-the-counter (OTC) markets to national exchanges. Uplisting offers broader visibility, institutional investment opportunities and the resources necessary to accelerate the deployment of AI and robotics innovations. Nightfood Holdings Inc., doing business as TechForce Robotics, exemplifies this approach. By completing targeted acquisitions, the company has built a platform that integrates revenue-generating assets with AI-enabled robotics technology. Nightfood Holdings now reports more than $10 million in annualized revenue and a combined acquisition value estimated at approximately $100 million, positioning it to move from expansion to execution as an exchange-ready entity.

After years of capital crowding into overvalued growth sectors such as technology and AI, investors are increasingly turning to real assets, specifically looking at producers and near-producers in precious metals, as the next destination for capital flows. What makes this moment unique is that gold and silver are reaching new all-time highs even as equity markets rally, creating a rare environment of rising hard-asset values alongside broad market strength. While speculative exploration has long defined the junior mining space, a new class of companies is emerging: fully funded, fully permitted projects on the cusp of production, with tangible near-term cash flow potential. An example of this type of opportunity is ESGold Corp., which exemplifies the shift toward juniors that can deliver value now, not just promise tomorrow. About ESGold Corp. ESGold Corp. (CSE: ESAU) (OTCQB: ESAUF) is a fully permitted, preproduction resource company at the forefront of clean mining and exploration innovation. With proven expertise in Quebec, the company is advancing its projects toward production and feasibility while delivering long-term value through sustainable resource recovery and exploration.

(Nasdaq: PCRX), the industry leader in its commitment to deliver innovative, non-opioid pain therapies to transform the lives of patients today reported it has received a Paragraph IV Certification Notice Letter (PIV Notice) from The WhiteOak Group, a subsidiary of a small private Chinese company. WhiteOak has filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, with the FDA for a product claiming to be a generic of EXPAREL. Neither WhiteOak nor its parent company have any commercialized products. The parent company is Zhejiang Haichang Biotechnology Co Ltd. In the PIV Notice, WhiteOak alleges that the claims of 19 EXPAREL patents listed in the FDA’s Orange Book (U.S. Patent Nos.11,033,495, 11,179,336, 11,278,494, 11,304,904, 11,311,486, 11,357,727, 11,426,348, 11,452,691, 11,819,574, 11,819,575, 11,925,706, 12,144,890, 12,151,024, 12,156,940, 12,226,610, 12,251,468, 12,296,047, 12,318,483, 12,370,142) are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by WhiteOak’s manufacture, use or sale of the product described in its ANDA submission. The company’s contested Orange Book listed patents are primarily from two distinct patent families with the first family expiring on January 22, 2041, and the second family expiring on July 2, 2044. Pacira intends to vigorously assert and enforce its intellectual property rights and has 45 days from receipt of the PIV Notice to file a lawsuit if it deems the ANDA filer is infringing its intellectual property. The lawsuit will trigger an automatic 30-month stay of FDA approval of White Oak’s ANDA submission pursuant to the Hatch Waxman statute. About Pacira Pacira delivers innovative, non-opioid pain therapies to transform the lives of patients.

(NASDAQ: QNRX) (“Quoin” or the “Company”), a late clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company focused on rare and orphan diseases, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) to its lead product candidate, QRX003, for the treatment of Netherton Syndrome. The designation follows previously granted Orphan Drug Designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in May 2025. The FDA's Orphan Drug Designation program provides orphan status to therapies intended for the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of rare diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. This designation provides certain benefits, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing, waiver or partial payment of FDA application fees and seven years of market exclusivity, if approved. QRX003 is on track to potentially become the first approved treatment for Netherton Syndrome. “Receiving Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA is yet another important milestone in our mission to bring QRX003 to patients suffering with Netherton Syndrome,” said Dr. Michael Myers, CEO of Quoin Pharmaceuticals. “Together with the EMA designation granted earlier in the year, this latest recognition by the FDA could potentially help facilitate the pathway of QRX003 to approval in the US whilst providing significant data protection to the product, if approved. Quoin remains steadfastly committed to completing the clinical development of QRX003 with a high degree of urgency on behalf of patients and families living with this devastating disease.” QRX003 lotion (4%) is being evaluated in two late-stage whole body pivotal clinical trials for Netherton Syndrome.

In February 2025, 374Water announced its participation in a highly anticipated DoD project, led by the Defense Innovation Unit (“DIU”) in collaboration with DoD Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (\"ESTCP”), to evaluate commercial-scale technology solutions to destroy per- and polyfluoroalkyl (“PFAS”) contaminated wastes. Generally, the DIU focuses on accelerating the adoption of commercial technology to solve operational challenges at speed and scale, and this project was designed to demonstrate and promote the application of technologies that can fully and cost-effectively destroy PFAS-containing wastes. For six weeks from July through September 2025, 374Water processed a total of six representative concentrated PFAS-impacted wastes at a Clean Earth Treatment Storage and Disposal Facility (“TSDF”) located in Detroit, MI in a series of one day trials using its AirSCWO™ 6 System. In total, approximately 900 gallons of PFAS-laden feedstocks were treated over 80 hours of runtime. Concentrated wastes processed included Surface Active Foam Fractionation (“SAFF”) foamate, a Cyclodextrin-based media regenerant distillate solution, an ion exchange regenerant still bottoms solution, Aqueous Film-Forming Foam (“AFFF”), spent granular activated carbon (“GAC”), and spent ion exchange resin (“IX”).

Tailored to the needs of electric vehicles (xEVs), clean energy power conversion systems, and AI data center power supplies, the ACS37100 achieves an industry-leading 50 ns response time, providing the high-fidelity data needed for optimal efficiency and protection in demanding high-frequency applications. Migration to GaN and SiC promises greater power density and efficiency, but their faster switching speeds create significant control challenges. At sub-megahertz frequencies, conventional magnetic current sensors lack the speed and precision to provide the high-fidelity, real-time data required for stable control and protection loops. This can leave advanced systems vulnerable to damage and may prevent them from operating at their full potential. The ACS37100 is engineered to solve this control challenge. Its industry-leading bandwidth and response time provide the high-fidelity current sense feedback essential for demanding control loops in high-speed switching applications. This magnetic current sensor enables designers to confidently and reliably control faster systems, maximize efficiency, and increase power density. Leveraging advanced TMR technology, the device delivers exceptionally low noise of 26 mA root mean square (RMS) across the full 10 MHz bandwidth—enabling precise, high-speed current measurements for more accurate and responsive system performance. “The ACS37100 marks a critical inflection "

This additional infusion of 1 million CER-1236 cells per kilogram of body weight of the patient -- completed approximately one week ago and identical to the first two doses -- is intended to generate further safety and dosing information that may help assess the feasibility of a multi-dose administration strategy as an alternative to a single, higher-dose approach. The initial dose level for Cohort One was selected based on dose ranges commonly used in other adoptive T-cell therapy studies. The third infusion in this patient occurs prior to the first dosing of the first patient in the previously announced second cohort of the study , which is anticipated in the coming weeks, pending completion of study-related regulatory notifications and approvals.  It also takes place as the Company has completed the first tranche of a planned $7 million financing (approximately $2.3 million) with existing shareholders.  This additional financing is expected to extend its cash runway and support efforts to maintain compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements. The first-in-human, multi-center, open-label, Phase 1/1b study is designed to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of CER-1236 in patients with acute myeloid leukemia that is either relapsed/refractory, or in remission with measurable residual disease, or newly diagnosed patients with TP53 mutated MDS/AML or AML. The two-part study initiated with do"

    "content": "INDIANAPOLIS, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Elate, the strategy platform built for Strategy and Operations leaders, today announced the public launch of Strategy Advisor , the first domain-specific AI designed to transform how organizations plan, align, and execute strategy in real time. Strategy Advisor acts as the intelligence layer across the Elate platform, connecting past plans, current execution, and emerging risks into one unified, AI-powered view. The result is clarity leaders can trust, confidence in every decision, and foresight to act before problems spiral into missed results. “For too long, strategy has been reactive, defined by static plans and manual reporting,” said Brooks Busch , Co-Founder and CEO of Elate. “With Strategy Advisor, we’re redefining how strategy gets done. It’s not about replacing human judgment. It’s about giving leaders the clarity, foresight, and conviction to make better decisions, faster.” AI Built for Strategy, Not Just Productivity While most AI tools focus on general productivity or analytics, Strategy Advisor was purpose-built for the complex, cross-functional work of strategic execution. Leveraging years of experience leading strategy and insights from thousands of operating cycles, the system understands the frameworks and rhythms of strategy work. Core capabilities include: Risk Navigator: Detects early signals of breakdown across teams, timelines, and outcomes—guiding leaders from root cause to resolution. Reporting Assistant: Transforms updates into executive-ready reports tailored by tone, audience, and format in seconds. Plan Analyzer: Extracts insights from decks, documents, and spreadsheets to transform static plans into connected execution. Each feature follows Elate’s human-in-the-loop principle where AI supports, but leaders decide. This approach ensures transparency, trust, and data security. A New Era of Strategy Founded in 2019 by former Strategy and Operations Leaders, Elate has helped hundreds of organ"

    "content": "CHANDLER, Ariz., Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As connectivity standards and market needs evolve, upgradeability has become essential for extending device lifecycles, minimizing redesigns and enabling differentiated features. To solve this challenge, Microchip Technology (Nasdaq: MCHP) has released the highly integrated PIC32-BZ6 MCU that serves as a common, single-chip platform to reduce development cost, complexity and time-to-market for multiprotocol products featuring advanced connectivity and scalability. “The PIC32-BZ6 MCU stands out for its powerful blend of connectivity, integration and flexibility in a single-chip solution,” said Rishi Vasuki, vice president of Microchip’s wireless solutions business unit. “Few devices bring together this breadth of features in a single chip, and we’re already seeing strong tremendous early adopter activity. Customers are leveraging its multiprotocol wireless capabilities, advanced analog features and high I/O to develop smarter, more connected products with greater efficiency.” RF design for smart devices has become increasingly complex, and wireless solutions typically require multiple chips to add new features or frequent redesigns to support evolving industry standards. The PIC32-BZ6 MCU replaces these multichip solutions and reduces the redesign burden with a single, highly integrated chip that removes the complexity of multiprotocol wired and wireless connectivity. The MCU also includes analog peripherals to simplify motor control development, along with touch and graphics capabilities for advanced user interfaces and enhanced memory to support complex applications, heavy workloads and Over the Air (OTA) firmware updates. The PIC32-BZ6 MCU platform streamlines development of products in the smart home and for automotive connectivity, industrial automation and wireless motor control use cases.

(NYSE: VATE) (“INNOVATE” or the “Company”) announced today that MediBeacon Inc., a medical technology company specializing in the advancement of fluorescent tracer agents and their transdermal detection, and an equity method investment of INNOVATE, has received approval from the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for Lumitrace ® (relmapirazin) injection, a non-radioactive, non-iodinated fluorescent GFR agent. Lumitrace will be sold as an integral component of the Transdermal GFR System in China. Lumitrace injection, together with the MediBeacon ® TGFR Monitor and MediBeacon ® TGFR Sensor, allow assessment of kidney function by measuring the clearance rate of the fluorescent agent as it leaves the body. The result is a transdermal assessment of Glomerular Filtration Rate or kidney function (tGFR). A commercial and clinical development partnership between MediBeacon and Huadong Medicine was formed in July 2019. The TGFR will now be introduced into the clinic where it is designed to be an important tool for physicians who care for patients where kidney health is a concern. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is estimated to affect 11% of the 1.4 billion people in China. 1 In January, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the MediBeacon TGFR including Lumitrace injection for the assessment of kidney function in patients with normal or impaired renal function. In February, the NMPA approved the MediBeacon TGFR Monitor and MediBeacon TGFR Sensor in China where Lumitrace ® (relmapirazin) injection is categorized as a drug with a separate approval process. “Full China approval is a major step forward in our commitment to expanding access to transdermal GFR global"

    "content": "SUNNYVALE, Calif., Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Real-Time Innovations (RTI) , the software framework company for physical AI systems, today announced that RTI Connext® has been named a Gold Honoree in the 2025 Military + Aerospace Electronics Innovators Awards. This recognition highlights RTI’s impact – from prime contractors to emerging innovators – in fielding new systems quickly enough to keep pace with rapidly evolving threats while ensuring they remain secure and interoperable. The Department of Defense is placing increasing emphasis on adopting commercial technologies to shorten development timelines and lower costs. Initiatives like DIU and Replicator are designed to bring dual-use technologies into the field faster while maintaining interoperability across programs. At the same time, threats are emerging faster than traditional acquisition processes can manage, underscoring the need for software-first systems that can both field quickly and evolve continuously. “Connext helps programs move from prototype to deployment faster while maintaining the reliability defense systems require,” said John Breitenbach, Director of Aerospace and Defense at RTI. “This award affirms our ability to deliver uncompromising reliability alongside relentless innovation, ensuring defense systems deploy quickly and continuously adapt as missions and threats evolve.” Connext is used in a range of U.S. missile defense and C-UAS platforms, including Aegis, IBCS, THAAD, and SPY-6 radar, and is trusted by 45 of the world’s top 50 defense contractors. Built on the open DDS standard, it provides a modular, data-centric architecture that enables secure, real-time information exchange and the ability to integrate new components without major redesign. This approach allows programs to field capabilities quickly while maintaining the flexibility to adapt as missions and threats evolve. As a Silicon Valley company with deep roots in defense, RTI operates at the intersection of commercia"

The presentation, titled “ Decoy-resistant IL-18 combination with bispecific T-cell engager enhances anti-tumor efficacy, ” was delivered at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress. Data presented at the conference showed that adding ST-067 to treatment with BiTEs enhanced tumor growth inhibition without observed weight loss, compared to treatment with BiTEs alone. Positive results were observed across models of solid and hematologic malignancies, including melanoma and humanized models of colorectal cancer and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. ST-067 also demonstrated potential to induce immunological memory that inhibited tumor growth upon re-challenge, compared with an untreated control group. “The findings presented at ESMO further strengthen our confidence that decoy-resistant IL-18 has the unique potential to act as a universal T-cell enhancer across treatment modalities,” said Sanuj Ravindran, M.D., chief executive officer of Simcha Therapeutics. “We look forward to advancing collaborations to evaluate ST-067 in combination with bispecific therapies, while also continuing our development efforts integrating ST-067 with additional forms of T-cell mediated therapeutics.” ST-067 is the first decoy-resistant variant of IL-18, designed to be impervious to the decoy receptor IL-18BP, which prevents IL-18 from binding to its receptor. As the most clinically advanced engineered IL-18 agonist, ST-067 is currently being evaluated in multiple clinical studies, as monotherapy post hematopoietic stem cell tra"

    "content": "CHICAGO, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ModelOp , the leader in AI lifecycle management and governance software for the enterprise, today announced the release of its new whitepaper, “ The Enterprise’s Guide to Preparing for Agentic AI .” The report warns that enterprises are unprepared for the speed and autonomy of AI agents now entering production environments— and outlines a practical roadmap to achieve control before the next wave of Agentic AI reshapes business operations. Real-world examples also are included, such as Replit’s database deletion, Asana’s MCP integration leak, and Salesforce credential breaches—demonstrating how a single rogue or compromised agent can inflict massive operational and reputational harm. “Agentic AI will not wait for enterprises to be ready,” said Pete Foley, CEO of ModelOp. “This whitepaper gives leaders a clear roadmap to prepare, protect, and scale responsibly—turning what could be catastrophic risk into a source of competitive advantage. Agentic AI can unlock true digitalization—the end-to-end automation of business processes and smarter decision-making at scale. Our research shows that the difference between innovation and disaster lies in one word: control.” The whitepaper highlights that Agentic AI represents both the greatest opportunity and the greatest risk of the decade. Unlike traditional AI models, these systems act autonomously — making decisions, executing tasks, and directly interfacing with enterprise systems without human approval. Gartner forecasts that by 2027, half of all business decisions will be augmented or automated by AI agents, and by 2028, at least 15% of daily work decisions will be made autonomously. Key Findings from the Report ModelOp’s research identifies the top risks facing enterprises experimenting with autonomous agents today: Data Leakage: Misrouted data and unsecured Model Context Protocol (MCP) connectors are already being exploited, as seen in the Salesloft–Drift–Salesforce data theft "

(OTCQX: PETV; OTCID PETVW), in cooperation with its wholly-owned subsidiary PetVivo Animal Health, Inc., an emerging biomedical device company focused on the commercialization of groundbreaking medical products for horses and companion animals, today announced it has entered into an exclusive 10-year white-label licensing agreement with Digital Landia Holding Corp for breakthrough Agentic Pet AI technology. The Agentic Pet AI technology addresses two critical challenges facing the veterinary industry: i) skyrocketing client acquisition costs, and ii) the difficulties in capturing the exploding Gen Z pet parent demographic. The implementation of the Agentic Pet AI technology has the potential to deliver a 90% - 98% reduction in client acquisition costs, dropping from $50 - $150+ per client to just $1.50 - $5.00 per targeted outreach, while simultaneously providing veterinary practices with unprecedented access to this fastest-growing segment of Gen Z pet parents. THE OPPORTUNITY: GEN Z PET BOOM MEETS MARKETING VOID A seismic demographic shift is reshaping the pet care industry and veterinary practices around the world, which requires adaptation. Gen Z pet parenthood surged 43.5% in 2024 alone, with Gen Z and Millennials now representing 57% of all pet parents in America. The generational differences are striking. While previous generations viewed pets as companions, 48% of Gen Z consider their pets actual children, fundamentally changing their approach to pet healthcare. Cat parenthood is exploding among this demographic, up 18% year over year. The veterinary industry is beginning to take notice of this shift in customer demographic. Despite this seismic shift, many veterinary practices still allocate their modest marketing budgets toward traditional channels targeting older dog owners, creating a potential disconnect with the tech-savvy, data-driven, companion animal-loving generation that repre"

LOUIS, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MediBeacon Inc. , a medical technology company specializing in the advancement of fluorescent tracer agents and their transdermal detection, announced that MediBeacon’s Lumitrace ® (relmapirazin) injection, a non-radioactive, non-iodinated fluorescent GFR agent, has been approved by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA). Lumitrace will be sold as an integral component of the Transdermal GFR System in China. Lumitrace injection, together with the MediBeacon ® TGFR Monitor and MediBeacon ® TGFR Sensor, allow assessment of kidney function by measuring the clearance rate of the fluorescent agent as it leaves the body. The result is a transdermal assessment of Glomerular Filtration Rate or kidney function (tGFR). A commercial and clinical development partnership between MediBeacon and Huadong Medicine was formed in July 2019. The TGFR will now be introduced into the clinic where it is designed to be an important tool for physicians who care for patients where kidney health is a concern. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is estimated to affect 11% of the 1.4 billion people in China. 1 In January, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the MediBeacon TGFR including Lumitrace injection for the assessment of kidney function in patients with normal or impaired renal function. In February, the NMPA approved the MediBeacon TGFR Monitor and MediBeacon TGFR Sensor in China where Lumitrace ® (relmapirazin) injection is categorized as a drug with a separate approval process. “Full China approval is a major step forward in our commitment to expanding access to transdermal GFR globally,” said Steven Hanley, CEO and Co-Founder of MediBeacon. “China represents a significant opportunity,"

Meister Seelig will represent Nerayoff in his Federal Tort Claims Act lawsuit against the Federal Government seeking $9.6 billion in damages. “I am pleased to be represented by one of New York’s premier law firms,” said Steven Nerayoff. “It’s important that we hold bad actors within the U.S. Government accountable, so that no innocent American is targeted again.” \"Mr. Nerayoff was maliciously prosecuted in the face of clear exculpatory evidence,” said Stephen B. Meister, a founder of Meister Seelig & Fein. “This was an egregious and unlawful action by the Government, and Mr. Nerayoff suffered vast damages as a result. We intend to hold the Government accountable and look forward to seeking justice on his behalf.\" Additionally, Meister Seelig & Fein will represent Nerayoff and CloudParc to enforce and defend its pioneering inventions and patent portfolio. The patents, including U.S. Patent 9,607,214, protect core technologies that make real-time intelligent decision-making possible. Nerayoff’s breakthroughs are foundational to many of the most significant applications of AI today. “Mr. Nerayoff’s patents are essential to intelligent, real-time operations in hardware and software and impact many modern industries, such as autonomous driving, humanoid robotics, and smart cities,” said Seth Ostrow, head of Meister Seelig’s patent group. “We look forward to helping Mr. Nerayoff achieve the recognition and compensation he deserves for his foundational breakthroughs.” The portfolio comprises more than 40 issued and pending U.S. and international patents, spanning key jurisdictions including China, Russia, European Union members, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and others across the world — underscoring the significance of Nerayoff’s foundational IP.

    "content": "SAN FRANCISCO, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The NIH has awarded a new grant to Posit Science , the maker of the online BrainHQ brain exercises, to advance research, which showed in a neuro-imaging study published last week , that their brain exercises can significantly upregulate the production of a key brain chemical (acetylcholine) – known to downregulate with normal cognitive aging and to decline more severely with pre-dementia and dementia. The new grant will help fund a study among people with the pre-dementia condition mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to see if their acetylcholine will be upregulated and their cognitive performance will improve. MCI is a medical designation for cognitive impairment that exceeds normal age-related loss but does not yet meet the criteria for a dementia diagnosis. The Alzheimer’s Association estimates that 12% to 18% of people over age 60 have MCI, and that 10 to 15% of people living with MCI develop dementia each year. The percentage converting to dementia increases with age, but most do not progress to a dementia diagnosis. There is no generally accepted successful treatment for MCI, though some interventions have shown positive results in studies. The most prescribed medications for Alzheimer’s disease are cholinesterase inhibitors (such as Aricept ® ), which artificially flood the brain with acetylcholine to provide transient benefit, but do not fix its downregulated production. “We are honored and excited to receive this NIH research grant,” said Dr. Henry Mahncke, CEO of Posit Science. “This grant – and the reactions from brain chemistry experts – underscore how pivotal the results are that were reported last week by our colleagues at McGill University, who ran the INHANCE Study. I suspect we’ll look back at the INHANCE Study as a turning point in the science of addressing cognitive aging, pre-dementia, and dementia.” The INHANCE neuroimaging study randomized 92 older adults into either (a) an intervention group, whic"

(AskBio), a gene therapy company wholly owned and independently operated as a subsidiary of Bayer AG, today announced the publication in peer-reviewed journal Nature Medicine of 12-month data from its Phase 1 trial of AB-1002 investigational gene therapy in participants with congestive heart failure (CHF) . 1 This non-randomized, sequential dose-escalation trial ( NCT04179643 ) includes escalating dose cohorts to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of investigational gene therapy AB-1002 in participants with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III non-ischemic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). 1 It is estimated that 64 million people worldwide are living with heart failure, and despite standard of care, mortality and morbidity remain very high. 2,3 The publication, which is available online , confirms that no adverse events were deemed related to AB-1002 in this trial and that clinically meaningful improvements were recorded across several efficacy assessments in participants with non-ischemic CHF. 1 The data further support that the AB-1002 capsid may be highly cardiotrophic when administered as a single intracoronary injection.

The noninvasive AMF treatment was delivered as an adjunct to surgery in a patient with a serious medical condition involving a prosthetic joint infection (PJI). PJI is a debilitating and costly complication that typically requires surgical intervention, often involving complex, aggressive procedures. In severe cases, PJI can lead to amputation or death at rates comparable to many well-known cancers. The compassionate use of the Solenic AMF treatment was performed in collaboration with the patient’s care team. No device-related adverse events have been reported to date, and on-going patient monitoring has indicated that the treatment has progressed positively. This case follows the completion of enrollment in Solenic’s human feasibility safety study with collected patient follow-up ranging from 6 weeks to 3 months. Again, no device-related adverse events have been reported to date from that study. “We are highly encouraged to see the continued progress in the compassionate use patient’s recovery,” said Bart Bandy, Solenic Medical CEO. “Looking ahead, we are also excited to connect with orthopedic surgeons attending the upcoming AAHKS meeting to discuss how we are advancing our AMF technology and our intent to bring it to more patients soon. We are committed to addressing this un-met need and bring to market an effective, non-invasive new standard of care for patients with this challenging condition, recognizing that global joint replacement procedures are projected to grow at a record pace over the next five years.” This compassionate use case was made possible through FDA’s Expanded Access program, which allow patients with a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condit"

The study, The True Cost of Trust in Marketing Measurement , surveyed 196 U.S. marketers and found that while most (62%) have some confidence in their performance metrics, more than half (54%) reported no change in confidence year over year, and 14% said it has actually declined. \"Marketers have access to more data than ever before, yet effective and trustworthy measurement is getting harder—not easier—to come by,\" said Brian Silver, Executive Vice President of Global Marketing Solutions at TransUnion. \"A lot of that comes down to chaos we're seeing in marketing today. More channels and touchpoints create new opportunities, but also new challenges to getting a unified view of marketing performance.\" Internal Skepticism Is Putting Budgets at Risk The research highlights that 60% of marketers say internal stakeholders question the validity of their metrics at least sometimes. Nearly 29% report that up to 20% of their marketing budgets have been reallocated or put at risk due to doubts about measurement accuracy. Because of that increased pressure, proving performance has become critical: 67% now prioritize incremental ROI, followed closely by aligning marketing metrics to business outcomes (66%) and improving cross-channel attribution (55%). Fragmentation Undermines Trust Marketers cited siloed and incomplete data (49%), cross-channel deduplication issues (48%), and walled-garden reporting limitations (41%) as their top barriers to accurate measurement. \"The key to unified measurement is unified data, and that starts with breaking down the walls between systems that were never designed to work together,\" said Jeremy Rose, Head of Unified Marketing Measurement at Bayer. \"Interoperability is the ability for data to move between platforms and systems in a consistent, usable"

The newest addition, MPL, is designed for traders who seek magnified, short-term bullish exposure to MP Materials Corp. (NYSE: MP), a leading rare earth mining and processing company. By seeking to deliver 200% of the daily percentage change in the share price of MP, the fund allows investors to express tactical upside views on MP’s stock performance, within the accessibility and transparency of an ETF. Investment Objective The Fund seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of two times (200%) the daily percentage change in the share price of MP Materials Corp. (NYSE: MP). The Fund does not seek to accomplish its stated objective over periods other than a single trading day. Underlying Stock: MP Materials Corp. MP Materials Corp. owns and operates the Mountain Pass Rare Earth Mine and Processing Facility in California—the only integrated rare earth mining and processing site of scale in the Western Hemisphere. MP Materials produces materials essential for electric vehicles, wind turbines, and other advanced technologies that drive the global clean energy transition. The company’s performance is influenced by supply and demand dynamics in the rare earth market, global trade policy, and the pricing of key materials such as neodymium and praseodymium. An investment in the ETF is not a direct investment in MP Materials Corp. The Fund is not suitable for all investors. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage, and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently.

    "content": "Toronto, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The federal government could add more than 25,000 youth jobs in the foodservice industry by eliminating the GST from restaurant meals, according to analysis by Restaurants Canada. The foodservice industry already employs more than 500,000 youth, representing one in five youth jobs in the country. “Restaurants are the number one source of first-time jobs for Canadians,” said Kelly Higginson, President and CEO of Restaurants Canada. “In fact, young people make up over 40% of foodservice workers. Our industry is perfectly positioned to help alleviate the youth employment crisis, and the federal government can facilitate that by permanently removing the GST from prepared meals, like it did at the start of the year.” The GST/HST holiday, which ran from December 15, 2024, to February 15, 2025, led to the creation of 24,000 new foodservice jobs, more than the previous 12 months combined. While the industry shed some of those jobs after the holiday, overall, it has added 23,600 jobs in the first nine months of 2025, more than the 21,200 jobs created across the broader private sector. Based on data from the GST/HST holiday and economic modeling, Restaurants Canada estimates that a permanent tax exemption on prepared food would lead to: 64,300 new foodservice jobs (40% of which are likely to go to people under 25) 15,685 additional spinoff jobs in related industries 2,680 new restaurants $5.4 billion in tax savings to consumers $1.5 billion in additional tax revenue and EI savings for government Additionally, every dollar in foodservice sales generates $2.30 in the wider economy, compared to a $1.90 average output for all other industries, meaning that an investment in the foodservice industry would create significant returns for the Canadian economy at large. The foodservice industry is facing an uncertain outlook Due to the affordability crisis facing Canadians and the lack of discretionary spending 75% of Canadians say they are "

Today, ProCap BTC announced that Eric Jackson has been nominated for election to the Board of Directors for ProCap Financial, Inc.

Konica Minolta Healthcare exhibited DDR at the Vizient Innovative Technology Exchange on September 17, 2025 in Las Vegas. Each year, healthcare experts serving on Vizient client-led councils review select products and technologies for their potential to enhance clinical care, patient safety, healthcare worker safety or to improve business operations of healthcare organizations. Innovative Technology designations are awarded to previously contracted products to signal healthcare providers the impact of these innovations on patient care and business models of healthcare organizations. “Congratulations to Konica Minolta Healthcare Americas, Inc. for achieving this peer-designated status,” said Kelly Flaharty, senior director contract services and Vizient Innovative Technology Program leader. “Our client council deemed Dynamic Digital Radiography worthy of this designation for its potential to make a real difference in the healthcare industry.” DDR is a novel, low-dose X-ray imaging technique available on Konica Minolta Healthcare DR Systems that captures both static images and cinegrams, providing an innovative way to obtain detailed images of complex joints while in motion and observe physiological cycles. By acquiring a series of images at high speed, DDR generates a cineloop that enables clinicians to visualize anatomical motion over time (cineradiography), enhancing the system’s diagnostic capabilities. Studies have demonstrated the clinical utility of DDR in pulmonary medicine, orthopedics and other specialized applications such as swallow studies or post-bariatric sleeve assessments. “Konica Minolta is honored to have DDR receive an Innovative Technology designation from Vi"

Following its acquisition of Seelos’ senior secured debt, GLD served as the stalking horse bidder in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York, and emerged as the successful acquirer through a Section 363 sale. The transaction includes Seelos’ late-stage ketamine and trehalose programs, both representing high-value opportunities in central nervous system (CNS) and rare disease therapeutics. “Seelos’ ketamine and trehalose assets align with our strategy of acquiring scientifically validated, late-stage programs that were undercapitalized but hold transformative potential,” said Daniel Gordon, Managing Director of GLD Partners LP. “Merged into our existing biotech portfolio, these programs will benefit from GLD’s focused regulatory strategy and execution discipline, enabling efficient advancement toward patient impact.” Clinical and Regulatory Pathway While prior trials of both ketamine and trehalose faced operational and clinical challenges, the underlying science remains compelling. With enhancements to the intellectual property and a renewed focus on trial design and execution, GLD aims to advance both programs through late-stage development to address high unmet needs in CNS and rare disease therapeutics. The ketamine program is positioned as a CNS therapy for major depressive disorder (MDD) and related neuropsychiatric conditions. GLD will initiate confirmatory Phase 3 pivotal trials aligned with FDA guidance, leveraging existing safety and efficacy data with enhanced study design and execution. The trehalose program is a disease-modifying therapy candidate for rare neurodegenerative and lysosomal storage disorders. GLD will progress trehalose into adaptive Phase"

(Nasdaq: BNC) (“BNC” or the “Company”) today announced that it now holds a total of 500,000 BNB tokens , with an average acquisition cost of approximately $870 per BNB , representing a total invested amount of $435 million and an estimated BNB value of $546.8million as of 1:00PM ET, October 20, 2025 . In addition, the Company retains approximately $50million in unencumbered cash and cash equivalents , bringing total crypto and cash holdings to $596.8 million . This latest acquisition further reinforces its position as the world’s largest BNB treasury company and moving it closer to its stated goal of owning 1% of total supply by the end of 2025 . BNB has gained renewed momentum in recent weeks, even as the broader crypto market struggles to find stability, this was driven by a surge in institutional interest and real-world adoption. Coinbase has added BNB to the list of assets under consideration for full platform support, while China Merchants Bank International (CMBI) recently tokenized its USD money market fund on the BNB Chain, issuing new tokens for accredited investors. In parallel, China Renaissance has reportedly begun building a $600 million BNB-focused digital asset treasury, reflecting growing corporate alignment around the ecosystem.

As we see leading institutions like Coinbase, CMBI, and China Renaissance actively engaging with the BNB ecosystem, it’s clear that this asset is entering a new phase of institutional recognition. We’ve always viewed BNB as more than a token, it’s the backbone of one of the most widely adopted blockchain i"

Atala Wave possesses all the performance features of previous Atala products—exceptional off-angle viewing, reliability, and unparalleled uniformity and contrast—within an ultra-thin, bendable profile. Manufactured on 0.1mm flexible glass, Atala Wave can bend to a minimum radius of 200mm to elegantly wrap around the contours of the vehicle. This flexibility enables sleek, curved designs that were previously unattainable with traditional lighting technologies. Without the need for heatsinks and diffusors, Atala Wave unlocks even greater design freedom for manufacturers, making bold, streamlined aesthetics effortless. “With the introduction of Atala Wave, OLED has moved into dimensional lighting design,” says CEO David DeJoy. “Manufacturers now have the capability of seamlessly blending sophisticated and intelligent lighting with the vehicle’s physical profile. With Atala Wave, we are thrilled to offer the next generation of automotive lighting that enhances both aesthetics and functionality.” Products immediately available for vehicle design-in include Atala Wave 1.0 and 2.0, which can include up to 128 individually addressable high-contrast lighting segments within each panel. Through dynamic animation sequences, fully customizable Wave products can increase Vehicle-to-X (V2X) communication, brand differentiation, and customer personalization through unique lighting signature selection. “Bendable OLED lighting that meets the high standards for automotive reliability has been a longtime goal for our team,” added Wolfgang Görgen, Managing Director of OLEDWorks GmbH. “Our team has poured passion and precision into creating a premium product that stands alone in the global market.

The initiative, held alongside the 2025 World Long Drive Championships, combines live competition, classroom learning, and hands-on demonstrations to illustrate how physics and mechanical principles drive elite athletic performance. “Golf is a perfect example of physics in motion,” said Akinobu Yorihiro, Chief Technology Officer at Newton Golf. “Through this program, we’re helping students connect what they learn in the classroom—velocity, torque, and energy transfer—to what they see on the tee box. When they watch a drive travel 400 yards, they’re seeing Newton’s laws at work.” As part of the clinic, Newton Golf representatives joined World Long Drive competitors and golf professionals to explore topics such as kinetic energy, launch angle optimization, and the material science behind modern golf equipment. Long Drive athletes Troy Teal and Josh Cassaday participated in the demonstration, showcasing the real-world application of physics in generating elite clubhead speeds and record-breaking distances. The event followed a standout week for Newton Golf at the 2025 World Long Drive Championships, where athletes using Newton Motion™ shafts delivered strong performances across multiple divisions. The company’s technology continues to gain traction among professionals for its ability to translate advanced shaft dynamics into measurable distance and consistency gains. “Our mission has always been to make performance measurable and repeatable,” said Dr. Greg Campbell, CEO of Newton Golf. “Seeing our technology used to both win championships and inspire students captures what Newton is all about—innovation with impact.” Newton"

The GotStocks Podcast shines a spotlight on the small-cap sector through in-depth interviews with executives leading promising companies poised for significant growth. The latest episode features Moishe Gubin, Chairman of OptimumBank Holdings Inc. (NYSE American: OPHC) , a single bank holding company that owns 100% of OptimumBank, a community bank headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. To begin the interview, Gubin discussed OptimumBank’s community focus and long-term trajectory. “We are a community bank that services businesses and individuals… We’ve been on the New York Stock Exchange for going on 25 years, and we broke a billion dollars in total assets in the last year. We’ve achieved 30-40% growth over the last 5-6 years, and we expect that to continue,” he said. “Our bank is geared toward customer service. We know that we can’t compete with a big bank in terms of national coverage, so we focus on how we take care of our customers and treat everybody as family.” He went on to describe how the company is positioning itself for sustainable expansion. “We’re currently earning about $20 to $25 million of net income a year. At a 10% capital rate, that gives us the ability to grow about $200 million a year. On top of that, we have no debt on our balance sheet today, so there’s opportunity for us to take in preferred debt. There are a lot of avenues we could go to bring in either equity or debt to carry our balance sheet.” Gubin also highlighted OptimumBank’s lending philosophy and high-touch client approach. “We haven’t had a bad loan in many, many years… Most of our loans are in Florida to borrowe"

    "content": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Chang Robotics today announced the release of “Risk-Taking Is Biblical,” the debut book by company founder and principal engineer Matthew Chang. The new book is now available worldwide and explores the profound relationship between faith, leadership, and risk, particularly in today’s volatile and evolving business climate. It offers a deeply personal and practical guide for entrepreneurs and innovators who lead with conviction. In “Risk-Taking Is Biblical,” Chang shares his own experiences of growth, education, and professional experience spanning multiple continents, as well as forging and growing the marriage and family that are his highest priority at all times. Chang is far from alone. A new study from Barna notes an increase of 30 million U.S. adults who report a personal commitment to the teachings of Jesus that is important in their lives. This new groundswell of belief is most significant in the younger Gen Z and millennial generations and is extending to U.S. businesses as well. In his book, Chang argues that risk is not only unavoidable but is essential to the progress we make in life and our ability to uphold our highest commitments to God. As a nationally known innovator and leader, Chang draws from his own experience in building Chang Robotics from the ground up as he tells the story of turning down an acquisition deal that would have brought him generational wealth but would have cost his team their independence. That choice reset his client list and revenue to zero but created the moral foundation for all that has followed. “Faith is not a safety net,” says Chang. “It’s a launch pad. Innovation, entrepreneurship, and leadership require a willingness to step into the unknown. When you take that leap, this is the environment in which faith comes alive.” Chang draws inspiration from the Parable of the Talents in the biblical Book of Matthew. It’s a lesson Chang believes defines the spirit of modern "

    "content": "NEW YORK, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A comprehensive new study by Springboards , an AI platform inspiring creativity in advertising, found that popular AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude and others perform much more similarly on creative tasks than many people think. Creativity Benchmark , conducted in collaboration with the 4As , ACA , APG , D&AD , IAA , IPA , and The One Club for Creativity , challenges the idea that there's a single \"best\" AI tool for creative work and shows agencies need more efficient ways to test AI tools for their specific needs. Sixteen different AI systems – from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Meta, DeepSeek, Alibaba and others – were tested on real marketing challenges across 100 notable brands. Over 600 creative professionals from ad agencies, marketing teams, and strategy firms made over 11,000 comparisons to see which ones worked best. The biggest surprise? There was no clear winner. The differences between the \"best\" and \"worst\" AI tools were much smaller than expected. \"Everyone assumes some AI tools are way better than others for creative work,\" said Pip Bingemann, CEO and co-founder of Springboards . \"But our tests showed the results were pretty close. Why? Because these models are machines designed to recognize patterns and give you the most probable answer—and 'probable' has never been called 'creative.' Keeping humans in the loop and optimizing for a wider range of varied ideas is crucial.” The study looked at three types of creative challenges: finding surprising insights about consumers, creating big campaign ideas, and coming up with bold, attention-grabbing concepts. Key Findings: Different AI Tools Win at Different Tasks: No single AI system was best at everything. Some were better at strategic thinking, others at wild, creative ideas. This means agencies might want to use different tools for different jobs. Variety of Ideas Matters Most: Some AI tools generated lots of different creative options for the same brief. "

    "content": "TORONTO, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The National Angel Capital Organization (NACO) today released its Report on a Unified Capital Strategy for a Sovereign Innovation Economy, calling for coordinated national action to unlock billions in private investment and strengthen Canada’s innovation economy. Download the full report: digital.builtbyangels.com/view/327527710 The report outlines a pathway to mobilize up to $15 billion in private capital and create up to 72,000 high-value jobs through a unified national strategy. It warns that fragmented, narrow policies have left Canada’s innovation economy structurally vulnerable, with early-stage companies starved of the capital they need to compete globally. Despite world-class talent and research capabilities, Canada invests considerably less in innovation than its global peers. Achieving venture capital (VC) intensity on par with Israel within five years would radically transform the structure of Canada’s economy, amplifying productivity and fueling broad-based prosperity. Closing this VC gap is essential to advancing Canada’s economic autonomy and long-term prosperity.

    "content": "BANDUNG, Indonesia, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Through PT Bio Farma (Persero), Indonesia has played a strategic and sustained role in the Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers’ Network (DCVMN), working to ensure equitable access to safe, high-quality, and affordable vaccines. Since DCVMN’s founding in 2000, Bio Farma has been a key driver in advancing vaccine self-reliance and public health capacity in developing countries. Collaboration between Bio Farma and DCVMN has been established since the inception of the network. At the first DCVMN Annual General Meeting in Noordwijk in 2000, Bio Farma was one of ten founding members dedicated to advancing vaccine collaboration. In April 2001, Bio Farma in Bandung hosted the 2nd AGM, where the network formalized the DCVMN’s structure and governance. Chaired by then-President Director Thamrin Poeloengan, this meeting established Indonesia as a hub for vaccine collaboration and knowledge-sharing among developing countries. Shadiq Akasya, current President Director of Bio Farma, stated that the company’s participation in DCVMN reflects Indonesia’s commitment to contributing to global health beyond national interests. “Bio Farma’s involvement in DCVMN since its establishment is not merely about representation, but about making a tangible contribution toward global vaccine self-reliance. Through collaboration and innovation, we are committed to delivering equitable and sustainable health solutions for all,” said Shadiq. “We believe that the true strength of the developing countries’ vaccine industry lies in collaboration. Through our active role in DCVMN, we aim to ensure that every nation has access to safe, high-quality, and affordable vaccines, a real manifestation of Indonesia’s contribution to global health security,” he added. In 2004, Bio Farma, together with other DCVMN members, played a vital role in expanding access to the pentavalent (DPT-HepB-Hib) vaccine through a technology-transfer collaboration with "

We look forward to working alongside First Nations and local communities to evaluate next steps.” The fall/winter 2025 drill program at Eau Claire, comprising approximately 10,000 metres, will focus on: Expanding resources along high-grade shoots, which were highlighted in the PEA mineable portion of the resource; Connecting the current resource outside of the PEA mineable portion to bring more of the existing gold ounces into an eventual development scenario; and Continuing to identify additional resource growth opportunities.

(NASDAQ: SDST) (\"Stardust Power\" or the \"Company\"), an American developer of battery-grade lithium carbonate, announced today that it has executed a Letter of Intent (the “Agreement”) with Prairie Lithium for the supply of 6,000 metric tons per annum of lithium carbonate equivalent (“LCE”) in the form of lithium chloride (“LiCl”). The lithium chloride is sourced from the Prairie Lithium Project in Saskatchewan, Canada and will be used as feedstock at Stardust Power’s lithium processing facility in Muskogee, Oklahoma. This Agreement marks a significant source of supply as the Company eyes a Final Investment Decision (“FID”) and the start of major construction. The supply Agreement with Prairie Lithium provides a foundation for near-term feedstock that enables the Company to accelerate its business model, strengthen customer engagement, and further de-risk the development of Phase 1. This Agreement also preserves flexibility for future phases to incorporate multiple chlorides as production scales. A key strength of Stardust Power’s strategy lies in its large central refinery engineered to process multiple approved lithium chloride inputs. This design enables efficient aggregation of feedstock and scalable production of battery-grade lithium carbonate. Supporting this approach, the Company continues to work with multiple producers and developers to bring their products to market, positioning itself as a critical hub in North America’s lithium supply chain. Under the Agreement, feedstock will be delivered to the Port of Muskogee’s Free Trade Zone, which offers strategic access to established water, road, and rail networks. The Free Trade Zone designation provides potential advantages such as tariff exemptions and reduced import duties. Initial deliveries are scheduled to begin as early as 2027, with volumes scaling up to 6,000 metric tons per annum with the opportunity for additional volumes. Prai"

Worry-free 10-year suspension warranty: Proof that it’s built to last Ferris was the first to engineer full suspension for riding mowers and we remain the industry leader, with more patents related to suspension than any other manufacturer. We have continued to advance our suspension in delivering a best-in-class ride for operators. “The 10-year suspension warranty is another indicator of the confidence we have in our suspension,” said Carissa Gingras, vice president of Marketing, North America Turf & Consumer Products and Service at Briggs & Stratton. “We know that operators love the comfort and productivity that Ferris suspension offers and now we’ve given them one more thing to love about their Ferris mower – proof of durability.” The new 10-year suspension warranty doubles the current 5-year suspension warranty and applies to any new Ferris mower purchased on or after November 1, 2025. In addition to the 10-year suspension warranty, most of our riding and stand-on mowers offer a 4-year/500-hour warranty with no hour limit in the first two years.* Suspension parts: No waiting Should you have a problem, Ferris is guaranteeing suspension parts shipped to our direct dealers in 24 hours to minimize any downtime. This move ensures that dealers will be able to service Ferris ® mower suspensions with OEM parts while minimizing shop-time for the contractors who want to get the unit back on the trailer as soon as possible. *See operator’s manual for full warranty details. ### About Briggs & Stratton Briggs & Stratton, headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, provides innovative products and diverse power solutions to help people get work done.

A right-sized stand-on that goes anywhere A game-changing new addition to Ferris’ Z1 family is providing contractors with the efficiency and benefits of a stand-on mower married with a 32-inch deck size that can get through gates and around restrictive landscaping. The smaller deck also takes up less room on a trailer, and despite the compact deck size the standing platform is wider and more comfortable than competitors. This new unit was built from the ground up and engineered to be lighter, designed for simplicity and with service and maintenance in mind. It comes with a very competitive entry-level price point. In keeping with Ferris’ leadership in suspension on commercial mowers, this new Ferris Z1 stand-on features a suspension platform with elastomer springs for drive comfort and reliability. The newest addition to the Z1 lineup also features a heavy-duty seven-gauge fabricated deck with drives and controls more balanced than others on the market. The unit has a patented low-resistance blade that results in less fuel consumption and reduced noise. For the first time in the stand-on segment, select units of this new Ferris Z1 will feature the Briggs & Stratton ® CXi 25hp engine with Oil Xtend™, a groundbreaking engine technology that delivers 250-hour oil maintenance intervals so landscapers can save money and reduce downtime.

    "content": "DARTMOUTH, Nova Scotia, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Over 130 workers at the Bridge by Adsum, the largest housing shelter in Atlantic Canada, have won their first Union contract. The Bridge workers will now have some of the highest wages in the sector across all the Atlantic provinces, an overnight shift premium of $1.50 per hour, retro pay to their Union certification, additional paid sicks days, a pension plan starting January 2027, and more. A tentative agreement was reached on October 10, after months of negotiations which followed months of delays by the employer. The workers ratified the contact on Monday October 20. “Ratifying this first contract means I can finally earn a wage I can live on and take the time I need when I or my kids get sick,” said Terri Ayles, a full-time Client Support Worker at the Bridge. She has two kids and works three jobs to make ends meet. “It’s about having the security to care for my family and not having to choose between a paycheck and our health.” “I have been through inferiority and discrimination after coming to Canada as an immigrant and a person of color,” said Veronica Warris, a full-time overnight Client Support Worker at the shelter. Warris was member of the Union’s bargaining committee. “Not only was I treated as an equal in the union, but my concerns were heard, valued, and even implemented in the process. I am so happy that I made the decision to join the union … the night premium and other benefits for us in this new contract … [are] a wonderful achievement.\" Workers started talking about forming a Union at the Bridge between late 2023 and early 2024. They believed they needed a voice at the workplace, fair scheduling, better health benefits that covered their families, and more paid time off. If these areas of the working conditions did not improve, they believed the Bridge would continue to suffer high burnout and turnover rates – and that was not just bad for workers, it was also a disservice to the communi"

(TSX.V: AEC; NASDAQ: AEC; FRANKFURT: 0AD) (“Anfield” or “the Company”) is pleased to announce the completion of a 20-hole, 8,000-foot confirmation drill program at its JD-7 mine, one of the five mines (JD5, JD-6, JD-7, JD-8 and JD-9) which make up the Company’s Paradox Mine Complex.   The drill results will be incorporated into a new uranium and vanadium resource report in Q1/26, alongside the additional drilling to be completed at the other JD mines. Significant intercepts of mineralization from the program include: 17.0 ft grading an average of 5,190 ppm (0.519%) eU3O8 in Hole JD7-25-004B, with a peak of 14,850 ppm (1.485%) eU3O8 at 153.5 ft; 19.0 ft grading an average of 2,380 ppm (0.238%) eU3O8 in Hole JD7-25-005, with a peak of 9,240 ppm (0.924%) eU3O8 at 170.0 ft; 17.0 ft grading an average of 1,620 ppm (0.162%) eU3O8 in Hole JD7-25-012, with a peak of 5,990 ppm (0.599%) eU3O8 at 185.0 ft; and 21.0 ft grading an average of 2,500 ppm (0.250%) eU3O8 in Hole JD7-25-014B, with a peak of 7,770 ppm (0.777%) eU3O8 at 212.5 ft. Corey Dias, Anfield’s CEO, commented: “We are very pleased with the drill results as they not only underscore the potential for resource confirmation and possible expansion at JD-7 but also align with Anfield’s broader strategy to advance its portfolio of near-term uranium and vanadium projects toward production. To that end, the creation of the Paradox Mine Complex reflects our plans to create specific targeted uranium and vanadium production centers as we advance these grouped assets through mine planning and, ultimately, production through Anfield’s Shootaring Canyon mill. Following the success of the Company’s drill program at JD-7, Anfield will commence underground drilling at its remaining JD mines, after which the Company will aim to issue an updated uranium resource for the Paradox Mine Complex which will now also incorporate the more-recently acquired "

(NASDAQ: PLUG), a global leader in comprehensive hydrogen solutions for the hydrogen economy, today announced the completion of the first phase of its hydrogen supply delivery of 44.5 metric tons for H2CAST (Hydrogen Cavern Storage Transition), a joint project led by Gasunie and STORAG ETZEL in Germany. Gasunie is an energy-infrastructure company and operator of gas pipelines in the Netherlands and North West Germany and STORAG ETZEL is the largest independent supplier of cavern storage facilities in Germany. The initiative is repurposing two existing salt caverns into underground storage for renewable hydrogen. Such projects are critical to advancing the energy transition, as salt caverns enable seasonal and high-capacity storage. They provide essential services such as grid balancing and flexibility for renewable energy integration, while ensuring a continuous supply of hydrogen to industrial users. This approach contributes to the development of the broader European hydrogen infrastructure. From April to August, 2025, Plug safely delivered hydrogen to the H2CAST salt cavern, meeting delivery timelines and proving the viability of large-scale hydrogen transport and storage in Germany. Following this successful pilot, Plug was awarded a second delivery mandate for an additional 35 metric tons of hydrogen to the same project H2CAST. Plug will continue to source the hydrogen from Hy2Gen ATLANTIS, the electrolyzer facility in Werlte, Germany, where Plug holds exclusivity on 100% of the green hydrogen produced. “The success of our recent projects in Germany with H2CAST show that hydrogen works, and that it is scalable for strategic national energy requirements,” said Jose Luis Crespo, President and CRO of Plug. “Plug’s ability to deliver hydrogen on time, at volume, and with our own transport and delivery equipment for our customers underscores Plug’s leadership in Europe’s fast-growing hydrogen ec"

(TSX – V: NBLC) (the “Company” or “Nobel”) is pleased to announce all necessary permits have been received to commence drilling at Cuprita (the “Project”) as early as November. This will be the first ever drill campaign at Cuprita. A notice was filed by the Company with the Copiapo office of Servicio Nacional de Geologia y Minera (SERNAGEOMIN) during the week of Oct 12 th . The Company intends to move quickly and drill the highly perspective Cuprita project. The first phase of drilling on Cuprita is expected to include diamond drill holes drilled from eight initial platforms, additional platforms will be added based on results. About Cuprita Curprita is a highly prospective copper porphyry project in the Atacama region of northern Chile. Cuprita is part of the Metallogenic Paleocene Porphyry Copper Belt that hosts several major porphyry copper deposits such as El Salvador, Cerro Colorado, Spence, Sierra Gorda, Fortuna, as well as several gold deposits. The Project sits on a very important north-northeast trending major structural corridor crosscut by a Northwest trending secondary structure. This structural setting is almost identical to the structural setting of the world class Spence, Sierra Gorda and El Salvador porphyry deposits to the north. Nobel geologists have identified multiple key geologic characteristics consistent with a potentially buried porphyry. During recent field campaigns, Nobel geologists identified a leach cap at Cuprita with an associated copper, lead and zinc anomaly in soils. The leach cap and soil anomaly are located adjacent to a ground magnetic low and are situated near the intersection of a major north-northeast striking fault structure with numerous northwest striking quartz veins with copper oxides. Intersecting major faults is a common, if not essential, structural control for the emplacement of copper-gold porphyries in the region (Figure 1). The presence of strongly "

(FlareTx), a clinical-stage biotechnology company targeting transcription factors to discover precision medicines for oncology and other therapeutic areas, today announced that it has entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Merck (known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada). FX-909, a first-in-class orally available small molecule inhibitor of PPARG, the master regulator of the luminal lineage, will be evaluated in combination with KEYTRUDA ® (pembrolizumab), Merck’s anti-PD-1 (programmed cell death receptor-1) therapy, in a new cohort within the company’s ongoing Phase 1 study in locally-advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer (UC). “FX-909 has achieved clinical proof of concept in the Phase 1A trial as a monotherapy, and we are very pleased to announce this agreement with Merck to add a combination arm to our ongoing Phase 1 study,” said Michaela Bowden, PhD, Chief Development Officer. “FX-909 directly targets luminal cancer cells along with driving immune modulation, inducing pro-inflammatory signaling and T-cell expansion in circulation. Combining FX-909 with an anti-PD-1 may provide a one-two punch to overcome IO resistance, opening the door to first-line treatment for advanced UC, earlier stages of disease, and other solid tumors in which PPARG actively drives immune evasion.” Under the terms of the supply agreement, Merck will provide its anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA to be used in combination with FX-909. The Phase 1 study combination cohort is expected to begin enrollment in the first quarter of 2026 and will investigate the safety, tolerability, immunologic effects and preliminary efficacy of escalating doses of FX-909 in combination with standard dose pembrolizumab in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma.

(OTCQX: LIMX), a global health, wellness, and lifestyle company founded by entrepreneur Jas Mathur, today announced plans to launch operations in India and select Asian markets in Q1 2026. For Mathur, who was born in New Delhi and raised in Montreal, Canada before building Limitless X in the United States, the expansion represents both a strategic milestone and a personal homecoming. “India gave me my roots. It shaped who I am,” said Mathur. “Now I want to give back to my people, to the community, to inspire them to believe in themselves, prioritize health, and build disciplined, purpose-driven lives.” With India now facing a growing wellness crisis – more than 77 million Indian adults are living with diabetes – Limitless X aims to deliver accessible, science-backed health and performance solutions across physical and mental wellness categories. The company plans to build joint ventures, licensing partnerships, and distribution alliances that merge U.S. innovation with India’s scale, creating local impact and global synergy. Beyond India, Limitless X will expand throughout Asia, beginning with the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia, in collaboration with global boxing icon Manny Pacquiao, who serves as Limitless X’s Global Brand Ambassador. The company also intends to leverage Mathur’s network across Hollywood, Bollywood and the Latin music industry to drive culturally resonant campaigns that connect wellness, entertainment, and community engagement. “Entertainment fuels awareness, and awareness fuels empowerment,” Mathur added. “Our mission is to unite some of the world’s most dynamic cultural communities through health, innovation and purpose.” Limitless X will launch national wellness campaigns to combat obesity and lifestyle disease; youth initiatives designed to build strength, discipline and self-belief, and celebrity-driven challenges and events that inspire participation, all with th"

    "content": "Dubai, UAE, Oct.  21, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has announced new details regarding its upcoming Version 1 (V1) protocol launch, confirming that ETH lending and borrowing will be among the first core features available on deployment. The V1 release marks an important milestone for the Ethereum-based DeFi project as it moves closer to realizing its goal of creating a transparent, efficient, and scalable on-chain lending ecosystem. Advancing Toward the V1 Protocol According to the project’s roadmap, the V1 protocol is scheduled to launch on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. This initial release will introduce Mutuum Finance’s core lending infrastructure, providing users with the ability to supply and borrow assets using smart contracts. ETH and USDT will serve as the first supported tokens for both lending and collateral, establishing a solid foundation for liquidity as the protocol prepares for broader deployment. Mutuum Finance’s platform is designed to improve the efficiency of decentralized lending by using two complementary systems: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) markets for major assets and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) markets for customized lending between users. This hybrid structure allows flexibility in how liquidity is provided and borrowed while maintaining transparency and security through blockchain automation. ETH Lending to Anchor Early Market Activity The decision to include ETH lending at launch reflects the protocol’s focus on integrating established, high-liquidity assets from the outset. ETH, as the base asset of the Ethereum network, offers consistent demand and deep market depth, helping Mutuum Finance achieve smoother lending dynamics during its testing and rollout phases. Depositors who supply ETH to Mutuum’s liquidity pools will receive mtTokens, digital receipts that represent their deposits and automatically accumulate yield as borrowers use the pool. These mtTokens can later be redeemed for the original asset plus earned interest, provid"

To date, six patients have been successfully enrolled into the trial, Of these, two patients were enrolled at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and four at Yale School of Medicine’s Department of Psychiatry. The multinational, multicenter Phase I/IIa trial is designed as a single- and multiple-dose study to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile of CMND-100. It will also explore preliminary efficacy signals, such as reductions in alcohol cravings and consumption, among participants who are either non-treatment-seeking individuals reporting heavy binge drinking or treatment-seeking individuals diagnosed with AUD per DSM-5 criteria. All participants must express a desire to reduce or stop drinking. Following FDA Investigational New Drug (IND) approval, the trial represents a critical step in advancing CMND-100 as a potential innovative therapy for the hundreds of millions worldwide affected by AUD, a condition where current treatments often fall short. “With the enrollment of the last patient in our first cohort, we are thrilled to reach this key inflection point in our CMND-100 trial, within an excellent timeline” said Dr. Adi Zuloff-Shani, Chief Executive Officer of Clearmind Medicine. “Building on the momentum from our first cohort enrollment and site activations at world-class institutions like Yale and Johns Hopkins, this progress underscores the growing interest in MEAI-based therapeutics and our commitment to"
